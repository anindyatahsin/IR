Another country going communist, those idiots don't suprise me, the communists are taking over in America as well.

If people could regulate themselves they'd stop buying the trashy tabloids. Wouldn't it be worthwhile for a government (a people) to invest a little in self-control?Maybe then we wouldn't need so many overlords. As it stands, most people aren't even conscious of the benefits of self-control.

American, exactly what I was thinking. We sent hundreds of thousands of our men and women over there for a visit back in the 1940's to fight and die to stop this little puke named Hitler from doing this to the people of Europe and now Britain and Europe are socailist and doing exactly what Hitler wanted to do in the first place...go figure!

no not commie... Muslim
