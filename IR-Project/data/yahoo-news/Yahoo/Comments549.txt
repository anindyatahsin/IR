Amazing that Buffalo finds a way to support a team, when Los Angeles cannot.

Why dosen"t  the state have former governour Pataki strike a deal for NYS, probably because he sure make a SNAFU with the Seneca Indian Casino deal.

Another great job by a politician working to preserve the best government money can buy.

How about putting a team on the field worth it!
