Oh well...The Corporate Elite created the "global market"...their problem, not mine. Besides, they'll make up any loss via crude oil speculation...their number one rip-off COMMODITY.

well if stocks are faltering perhaps stocks should wait until theres something to pay out on.Instead of speculating on events that may not happen or another way to look at it is if the punt approach is to be taken then make sure the bloody thing doesnt have a hole in it.

Stock martket falters on Cyprus news, I doubt it, the rich are taking their profits.

This dip will get bought and so will the next and the next.  The "FED" crowd has lost touch with reality.  If there was ever a market of pure unmitigated greed it's the stock market.  It will simply keep going up until it just doesn't.  We've only had 2 days of basically nothing in terms of selling compared to the buying that preceded it.

dang wheres Obungho ,,,, figured he would be first in line to bail them out

Cypress is just another RICH MAN's tax haven.......they'll get bailed out by the EU or the IMF

People are no more worried about stocks dropping than they are the unreal debt of our country.  The largest debt in the history of mankind by far and no one is even concerned.  They're arguing instead over microscopic crumbs like whether to hold White House tours or not.  Meanwhile the Hoover Dam spillways are running wide open.

See, I told you, AP always has a non US based reason for the stock market dips, while rises are credited to their savior, omama.

Arizona passed gold/silver currecy as dollar declines......

If you see this start to happen here(in America) You will have seventy-two hours to get ready.....This will get much much worse,you can find the magnitude of this in the foreign news,because We are not even being told the significance of this as it unfolds,There are holes left open to cause global crisis on a high scale.
