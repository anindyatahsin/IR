These comments are as stale as granny's undies

Great Day in the Morning. I bought another 200 shares of CVS when the market opened. Looking real good and will go much higher. Many who have no knowledge of the market, but like to make comments about the market will say "why"?I said yesterday pick up some CVS. Earnings report is due tomorrow morning.  They have performed well from top to bottom. Watch tomorrow and you will see a gain of 5-6% plus added to the gains today.

In this case about the drug store stocks. Just go and watch the parking lots to see who gets the most visiters. Peter Lynch stile (like my spelling?). Thats what I do somtimes.

I have a target for wag of $500.00...buy, buy, buy...don't let the declining sales andprofits trouble you, because we own allance boots in depression wrought europe

Wow...look what happens when a billionaire PUMPs the stock. Looks like Soros and Wasson are trying to cash out when the dumb money comes rolling in. BTW, wag is on track to a major miss in dec...not unlike nov., etc.

Wasson?    Ease up folks...even the people in charge of the Titanic had to decide who got a lifeboat before that particular big sucker went under......they even thought the Titanic was unsinkable.    Wonder if the Iceberg had words ESI/Medco written on it somewhere?

Walgreens CEO Greg Wasson who's pay has doubled from $6 million to $12 million in just 3 years, is shoving all low level managers out the door.  Then throw in the fact the stock has tumbled under his watch.  Who believes in this guy.
