No bribes?  Does this mean no campaign contributions then?  It sure should.

I thought all the bribes were only on Pennsylvania Ave and Wall Street? I'm right yeah I ain't wrong.. Right church wrong pew... Wall Street stinks stocks are tanking again...

Do you thnk anyone at Micorsoft is actually going to jail for this? Hilarous, they will be fined and that will be the end of it. However the average american citizen who got charged with bribery would almost certainly do time for it. Multinational corporations are above the law, esp. in the U.S. and have tremendous influence in our political process.

These days you have to bribe anyone to use MS products.

Way to go Microsoft!

Reality Ck.- Bribery is a way of life &amp; accepted as a way of doing business honorably in placeslike asia &amp; other parts of the world!

I guess bribery in those countries is not legal like in the US. Not too far along on the oligarchy as we are. Bummer.
