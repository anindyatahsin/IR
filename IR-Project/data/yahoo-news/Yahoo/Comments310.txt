He did not react to a witness pointing him out because he is a creepy sociopath. He really needs to hook up with Jodi Arias. Soul mates.

What a forehead

Is he a fake Rockefeller or is this a fake trial?

"Testimony begins in fake Rockefeller trial"As usual from the AP, another misleading headline for the sake of sensationalism, and the always present desire to insinuate a connection between wealth and evil.The murder trial has nothing to do with the fact that he had tried to pass himself off as a member of the Rockefeller family. Why don't they specifically mention, by name,all the other false identities he used ?He is on trial for murder; immaterial if he  once claimed to be a Rockerfeller, an Obama, or Mother Theresa.

Are they expecting smiles and waves from the little poser?  That would be creepy.

Give him a big bag of fake money and lock him in a cell with it.

What a freakin' loser!!!!!!!!!!!!!

And in seperate news, a new planet was discovered when light reflecting from his forehead lit up the Milky Way!!!!!!!!!!!!
