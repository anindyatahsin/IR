and ...?

"Washington needs Pakistan's help fighting al-Qaida and stabilizing neighboring Afghanistan, but a series of recent scandals have severely damaged ties."  -- Actually it is becoming obvious that we don't need Pakistan or Afghanistan.

As long as there are terrorists protected in Pakistan, the government will be protected by them. I suppose any one opposes this government will be killed by the terrorists. Any government under these conditions can stay in power. Talk about democracy - shameful

Drone 'em.

The question of the day is what did government achieve in this 5 years? There are lot of Rocks also lived  and remained for full 5 years without much contribution to human kind. The terrorism in the country is growing. Poverty is becoming universal. Practically people find no future in their country. Only thing they have successfully exported is terrorism and continue to do so with government support. Shias, Ahmadis and others are killed daily. Suicide bombing is flurishing. Army and ISI could not even find Osama Bin Laden who was living in their backyard. They did not even know when US went in and killed him until US informed them. What state of country? Even Banana Repuplblic may consider it is insult to caompare with the Pakistan.

Probably these were the only guys willing to oppose the Army / Taliban nexus ...... Great place, Visa on arrival !! :-)"Shahzad's body was found south of the capital, bearing marks of torture....The US military's then top officer, Admiral Mike Mullen, said Pakistan authorities may have sanctioned Shahzad's killing. Two days earlier he had written an investigative report in Asia Times Online saying Al-Qaeda carried out a recent attack on a naval air base to avenge the arrest of naval officials held on suspicion of Al-Qaeda links."
