Saudi border guards arrest 4,360 infiltrators

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) â€” A Saudi official says in a single month, border guards have arrested more than 4,000 infiltrators on the Yemen border, most of them looking for work.
Captain Ali bin Abdullah al-Qahtani, the border guard spokesman, said Sunday that 49 of those arrested were drug smugglers carrying more than 800 kilograms (1,800 pounds) of hashish.
Faisal bin Khaled bin Abdul-Aziz, the governor of the southwestern province of Asir, which borders Yemen, said Saturday that most of the infiltrators in his region are from Ethiopia, Chad and Somalia.
In the past, Saudi Arabia has reported blocking several infiltration attempts by militants from Yemen's al-Qaida branch to carry out attacks inside the kingdom.
