good luck,the same people you meet on the way up will be the same people you meet on the way down,for every winner there has to be a loser,in this ponzi scheme everyone will not be a winner,its the ones who get out early.3000 to 4000 point correction coming.

Cramer loves this stock!  Now you know why.  Because he is selling it while telling you to buy it.  #$%$ CRAMER YOU STUPID PHUKING #$%$.

I cant believe any self respecting american citizen is still doing business in any way shape or form from these losers.Some folks just have no moral values.I assure you none of these bankers are losing any sleep worrying about your tent city family.

Folks, hate to tell you, but BAC isn't trading on fundamentals, nor has it traded on fundamentals since it fell below $15 / shr.  This stock, with it's HUGE outlay of available shares and low stock price, make it ripe for algorithm traders.  That is the only thing moving this stock today.  It will be down 4% tomorrow as the algorithm calculations take their profits.  This type of hyertrading / cybertrading will continue until the bank finds resistance around $18 - $20 per share.  Any stock that high is unappealing to the cybertraders.

Bank on banks!

These banks can suck my johnson!
