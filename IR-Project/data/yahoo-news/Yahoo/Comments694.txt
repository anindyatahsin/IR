With Bernanke pumping $85 billion dollars of liquidity a month into the markets is it any wonder the market is going up? It sure isn't because of our economy.

Terrible news for the Stupid Party

No different than organized crime, except they don't have to worry about the law...

Bull market? More like mindless sheep market.Remember folks, the same sheep claiming to be "making millions a week," today will be the same sheep screaming about how the "1%" stole all their money when the market crashes.

This must be just killing the Obama-haters.

If you are still in the stock market???  You need severe psychratric help !!!

Have you ever watch doomsday preppers? I think they might be on to something. I don't know much about the markets but in an economy like now with everyone saying how fragile it is and businesses going under I don't understand how the markets can be at an all time high, unless someone is manipulating it? When it crashes hope all the 99% are buckled up and have their seats in an upright position because it is going to be a hell of a bumpy ride!!

Attention Dem libs! Under Obama the ultra rich are getting richer than they have under any president in history because of his fed printing money and dumping it in the stock market. Meanwhile, the lower class has nearly doubled since Obama took office. So you can no longer use "Republicans only care about the rich" as one of your main talking points because Obama owns it now.

GOP just can't that good news.   They liked market at end of Bush at 6,400.  They love it when their 401k was 70% less than today.
