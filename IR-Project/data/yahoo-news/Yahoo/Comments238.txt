Kirchner is a politician that has no values.  She will manipulate in any way the advances her aims.  She could care less about the Argentine people.

She only went to Rome to ask the Pope for help concerning the Falklands. Nothing more, nothing less, and nothing else!

There is no love between the two. Kirchner is a #$%$ and Francis is a Pope !

For a Bang Job the Pope will Excommunicate England's Prince Harry. Wait that's what got Henry VIII Excommunicated, better make it for the Full Monty instead.

Please stop saying that this President is Peronist. She's not, and the true Peronists don't want to be anywhere near this "lady".

GOOGLEfirst pope to kiss a woman in the cheek. Simultaneously first pope to bow to anyone and first pope to bow to a woman.

Bergoglio criticized it as an “attempt to confuse and trick God’s children.”............seriously, this isn't very hard to do.

Argentina's Kirchner and Pope Francis meet in Rome to compare Little Boy Superhero Underwear Collections :)

I really like this Ms. Kirchner, she seems like a brilliant politician and the more coming out about Francis is not flattering. Like she said, he's Medieval. Hope he has the courage to come into the 21st Century.

To see what a monster this 'man' is please read Erbitsky’s book, The Silence: From Paul VI to Bergoglio.Please stop saying that this President is Peronist. She's not, and the true Peronists don't want to be anywhere near this "lady".
