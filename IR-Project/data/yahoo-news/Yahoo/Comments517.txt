Please stop clogging up yahoo news with this 3 times a day.  Anybody can pull up a stock list and see this.

bunch of idiot,

find something else to waste your time. what kind of news is this that you send out 3 times a day. we know and we are watching it just like you. go out there and find something that we cant find on every stock quote sites.

Tell us something we don't already know.  Why clog up the "headlines" on yahoo with something like this when all you're doing is reporting the nose on our face.
