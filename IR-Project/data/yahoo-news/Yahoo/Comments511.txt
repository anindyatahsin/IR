program trading no reason for drop

They are just looking for another excuse to up the prices.

SVU made a fatal mistake in the Los Angeles market many years ago by abandoning the 'Lucky" supermarket logo.  Nobody could identify with the "Albertsons" name.  "Lucky" was a long time household name the LA market.  I think SVU should consider going back to that name.  They could make a startling recovery.

Is SVU is a great value now due to the recent decrease? Even though some press is listing some weakness, I am in this stock because it has strong cash flows and any debt would be resolved according to their plan to pay off $450-$500 million a year on debt (as it historically achieved in a similar fashion) with money to spare to build/start-up new Save-a-Lots stores and upgrade buildings. The Save-a-Lot is a real solid competitor and has good margins. The Save-a-lot division looks to be growing strong.Its asset sale value is much higher than the value listed on the balance sheet due to depreciation. That helps them pay down debt easier because of decreased income tax. It also makes them ripe for a possible purchase.Any losses are due to goodwill write offs. This does not always reflect the operations of the company. This can also help pay down debt due to tax releif, but its operations is making positive earnings with a large cash flow positive it uses to pay off debt and expand.I think this company is serious about helping its investors. I suggest you research this for yourself to make a decision that is not driven by hysterical manipulative news articles that drive panic selling based on emotional reaction.

Joe Albertson would roll over in his grave if he know what SVU has done to his company.It is a travesty.  I would not continue to count on the current dividend.

SUV looks like it is going to pop
