Ala. man pleads guilty to tweeting Obama threats




BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Federal prosecutors say a Birmingham man has pleaded guilty to using the social networking site Twitter to threaten the life of President Barack Obama.
                  
U.S. Attorney Joyce White Vance said 25-year-old Jarvis Britton entered the guilty plea Monday.
                  
A federal grand jury had indicted Britton in September on charges that he knowingly threatening to kill, kidnap or inflict bodily harm on the president. Prosecutors said he tweeted, "Let's kill the president. F.E.A.R.," on Sept. 14.
                  
Several people, including soldiers from Georgia's Fort Stewart, have been connected to a national militia group that prosecutors say was called F.E.A.R. â€” Forever Enduring Always Ready. They said the group had terrorism plans and an ultimate goal to overthrow the U.S. government and assassinate the president.
                  
Britton's sentencing is scheduled for June 20.
