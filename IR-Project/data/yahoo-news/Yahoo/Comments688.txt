Glock stock is way up...

Weapon Manufacturer stocks are better.

Humm, how many hospital execs are complaining about the AHCA?  Not many I bet

It's another reason Hospital CEO's are racking in millions in their pay.

Hospital stocks are up because of they're gouging on their bills. Dr. Oz just today said you must make Hospitals go down your bill line by line since they are cheating so much. Too many Americans are having to go in to Bankruptcy over their Hospital bills. One bill example was they charged $5,000 for those small paper cups they bring your pills in, how ridiculous! For 10 days in the Hospital.
