Only $8.5M?  Bummer for him!  That's only 200 average working people.  The board really showed him!

The 1% Party: 1% tax on wealth. 1% tax on income. 1% national sales tax. 1% unitary tax on corporations. 1% tax on stock trades. 1% tax on financial transactions. Bigger consumers pay bigger taxes. Fair is fair. No taxation without representation, and the middle class isn't being represented because the government is merely the enforcement arm of our corporate rulers.

No wonder smokes are $80.00 a carton. Cut his wages to a flat $200,000 a year, cut your prices in half and sales would go back up.

Everyone pointing fingers at the guy. Did you work 90 hours last week getting ready for the 5 conference calls you had to make on Wednesday? Did any of you have to deal with #$%$ harrassing you 24/7. Most of his money was in stock futures meaning the success or failure of the company was how he is getting paid. I say raise the price of cigarettes as he is obviously "making too much money". Who are you too judge someone else. All of you should be embarrassed you sound like a bunch of whinny #$%$. Get out there and get 2 jobs!

Just think of the number of lungs burned by their products under his leadership.... the number is bigger than his paycheck...
