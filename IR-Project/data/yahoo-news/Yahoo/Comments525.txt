This is why I love these comment sections -- folks who have NO idea what they're talking about bloviating with absolute certainty.  Meanwhile, most analysts who pore over the financials and who people with real skin in the game depend on are bullish on this company as it shakes up and redefines a formerly sleepy sector that was going to get its lunch eaten.

Walgreens...creating the pharmacy of the future, on a 7-11 budget. Just does't seem to add up. But, wallstreet likes the short term opportunity to "invest" in the stock.

Walgreens misses numbers for november...

Join Wasson and Co. at the corner of pump and dump and you will be one of the lemmings that go over the (fiscal) cliff in 2013. Consumer discretionary spending is going into the dumps deal or no deal in washington. You can buy this stock in the teens in 2013.

Things are not good at the "corner of addicted and dependent". Get out now before the economy and Wassons miss management take this once great company down. You don't have to pay these inflated prices to get the WAG dividend. Wait for the stock to plummet to the teens in the next six to twelve months...you still get the dividend. And, because you'll own twice as many shares...well, you do the math.

McDonalds help WAG?, well they tried their luck at reinventing pharmacy...guess they might as well try selling burgers at the drive-thru......maybe put gasoline pumps between lane one and two?
