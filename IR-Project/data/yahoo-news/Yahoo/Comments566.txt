How the ignorant masses self immolate to the tune of empty, clever promises.

at lease in Venza the poor get some of the crumbs from the rich.....in America,,,they get dirt!

just another #$%$ taester

MSNBC has already called this election in favor of their brother-in-arms Maduro .... no need to count ballots.  Viva Chavez is MSNBC's new slogan.

Thats a no brainer , more and more folks all over the planet realize the difference between "socialist utopia" and greed corrupt, violent , destructive fat butt hell hole capitalism!

.....and the poor will get poorer.After a while one starts to think they deserve it.

Venezuela, JUSTICE is at hand.  Capriles is highly qualified, all say that.  Chavez had to remove the loyal Maduro from many different posts, due to his clear incompetency.  The sentimental Vodoo game Maduro is playing will wane, he is lost!

Bwahahaha! Eat it teabaggers!

The thing you got to love about the great citizens of the USA is we want the freedom to elect our own representatives and those of everyone else too :).

U.S.A. = Greatest Country in the World.I'm so shocked that this is happening in a truly free and democratic republic... Oh wait it's not.

I'm originally from Venezuela and I'm so glad I don't live there anymore. These people are so ignorant!!!! All they have is subsidised poverty and they are happy with it. I was hoping that finally with the death of Hugo the country would turn around. Guess not.

Leftists have seized the press every where. Freedom, your days are numbered, every where.

Ignorant Gringos below babbling nonsense...

is 800 people even enough to make it meaningful?
