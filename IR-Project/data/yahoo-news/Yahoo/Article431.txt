SAfrica police boss endorses officers in killings




MARIKANA, South Africa (AP) -- South Africa's police chief stands by her statement that officers involved in the shooting deaths of 34 striking miners were just doing their job.
                  
Evidence before the judicial commission questioning her Tuesday has indicated some miners were shot in the back as they tried to flee and others were killed when they already were wounded and no threat.
                  
Gen. Riah Phiyega said "I stand by statement," repeating that after a commissioner asked her if she might feel differently given other evidence that has come to light.
                  
Police said they opened fire after striking miners attacked them. No police were hurt in the Aug. 16 incident at the Lonmin platinum mine in Marikana, northwest of Johannesburg, that shocked the nation with its echoes of police brutality under apartheid.
