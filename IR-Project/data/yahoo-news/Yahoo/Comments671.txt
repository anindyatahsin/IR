Sell out while you can and there maybe a few buyers with unrealistic hopes.

In the third World, not ONE hospital closes like this..but here....Let us fight...more WARS..! We can "bankcrupt" America faster..!!!!

My hospital is also running in the red in part due to the state not paying it's bills and to patients not following discharge plans and returning for no other reason than they are idiots.

Wait,Hold on,the community organizers so called Affordable Care ACT was supposed to save Jobs&amp;Money? What happened? was it all a Joke? A Ruse? Were we lied to Again?
