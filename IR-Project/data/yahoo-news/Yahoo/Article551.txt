Champion Ravens might not open at home




PHOENIX (AP) -- The Baltimore Ravens could open the season on the road because of a scheduling conflict with baseball's Orioles.
                  
The NFL traditionally kicks off the season with the Super Bowl champion as the host team on the Thursday night after Labor Day. But the Orioles are scheduled to be home that night at Camden Yards, which is located close by M&amp;T Bank Stadium.
                  
Commissioner Roger Goodell says Monday he has twice spoken with MLB Commissioner Bud Selig about switching the baseball game to the afternoon, with the Ravens' opener beginning later than usual in the evening. Moving the NFL game to Wednesday night is not alternative, Goodell says, because it is the first night of Rosh Hashanah.
                  
If no solution is reached, the Ravens could open on the road, but "I don't think that's fair for the Ravens' fans," Goodell says.
