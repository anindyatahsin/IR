Any   people   come    to   buy    one   slice    pizza   could   get  2   lobster    salads    for   free    .

........the fattenig of 'America".........rolls along.........keep eating all this #$%$ the way Americans do......these people will need more than Obamacare.....good treadmill..maybe..

I can't decide... lunch at King McWendy's, Wendy McKing's, or...

I remember when McDonald's was at 48 and change and I thought "people won't continue to buy this slop in record numbers" and passed on it...I am out of touch with reality.

Mystery meat found at tamale truck(local paper)  six skinned dogs were found-going into tac.

Oh, Wendy's. How low the mighty have fallen.

Last weekend I ate at Burger King for the first time in 7 yrs. It will be another 7 yrs (or longer) before I eat there again.

McDonald's in Brick NJ is the worse. No one speaks English in there, burgers are sitting under a heat lamp getting old and fries are served cold and limp. But if you look past all that, it does kinda sorta taste like a McDonald's burger and fries.

And therefore?????????????????
