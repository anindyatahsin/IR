Returning 'The Voice' adds extended episodes




LOS ANGELES (AP) -- NBC is making the most of its returning hit series "The Voice."
                  
The network said Monday the show will double to two hours on April 30 and May 7 to showcase pivotal rounds in the singing competition.
                  
"The Voice" begins its new season at 8 p.m. EDT on Monday, March 25, with another two-hour episode. NBC, struggling in the ratings, is counting on the show to provide a boost.
                  
Returning coaches Adam Levine and Blake Shelton will be joined by newcomers Usher and Shakira. They're stepping in for Christina Aguilera and CeeLo Green, who are taking a break from "The Voice" to focus on their music and other projects.
