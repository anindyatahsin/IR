Man accused of espionage worked in cybersecurity

HONOLULU (AP) â€” The civilian defense contractor accused of giving his Chinese girlfriend military secrets on war plans, nuclear weapons and missile defense started working at the U.S. Pacific Command about three years ago.
Benjamin Bishop's LinkedIn profile says he worked on cybersecurity starting last May.
It says the 59-year-old was a strategic planner working on deterrence for two years before that. This includes the time when federal authorities allege he began a romantic relationship with a 27-year-old woman from China living in the U.S. on a student visa.
Bishop is a Special Forces lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army Reserve.
His Army biography lists several honors including the Defense Meritorious Service Medal.
Bishop is being charged with willfully communicating national defense information to a person not entitled to receive it.
