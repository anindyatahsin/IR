Chicago police expect arrests in baby's killing

CHICAGO (AP) — A 6-month-old baby who was killed when a gunman fired at minivan in Chicago was on her father's lap at the time, Police Superintendent Garry McCarthy said Monday.
The father, Jonathon Watkins, was seriously wounded when the shooter approached the vehicle and fired. McCarthy said that Jonylah Watkins was sitting in his dad's lap in the driver's seat — a change from previous reports that Watkins was changing the baby's diaper at the time.
McCarthy also said the baby was shot once, not several times as previously reported.
"We are going to close this case, there's no doubt in my mind," said McCarthy.
McCarthy previously described the 28-year-old Watkins as a gang member with a long criminal history.
"At this point there's a lot more he can help us with, but (he) is cooperating with the investigation," McCarthy said.
McCarthy has said police have surveillance video that shows the van they believe was the getaway vehicle. And he said Investigators were trying to verify the existence of an alleged Facebook post threatening Watkins.
McCarthy also corrected previous reports that Jonylah's mother, Judy Watkins, was shot in the knee while pregnant with the girl. McCarthy says Watkins' wife was not shot.
Services for Jonylah are to be held Tuesday at a church in the Woodlawn neighborhood on Chicago's South Side where the shooting occurred. A local funeral home is paying for the services.
