It is a shame that the citizens of the USA allow OUR government to cater to foriegn countries while telling us that they have to cut back on our needs.

robbing peter to pay paul ,but peter is broke too !

How can we afford that with sequestration?  Seems we can always come up with cash to #$%$ away

the Dems want to GIVE WEAPONS to Syrian but take away weapons from law abiding Americans

When will these politicians learn to stop arming your future enemies.

We have no money for White House tours, but a Dem wants to throw some more borrowed money to Syria.   No wonder we are closing in on Bankruptcy.

Syria? What about home first!!!

Do not help the rebels. Do not help Assad. HELP AMERICA!! &amp; STAY OUT of their civil war.

Yes, lets arm another group of people that hate us, what could possibly go wrong. Seems like no one in politics learns from past mistakes.

Sure, Democrats would love to disarm us, but would think nothing of passing out actual military hardware to nut case muslims with homicidal tendencies that intend to use them to slaughter thousands more people. then when they run out of people to slaughter with our military hardware they'll turn all their attention and that military hardware on us or our troops. What could possibly go wrong with this clever scheme?

looks like the Dem's are out to bankrupt this country.I knew the people we got in Washington were stupid, But this Idea takes the cake.

I thought the repubs. were supposed to be the war mongers?

NO!  Let the Arab League help out Syria.

Democrats get off the spending kick and put your mouth and what little effort you contribute toward  AMERICA!!!!

Oh that's it arm the rebels and take our guns, bright idea

I wonder if this senior democrat is suggesting that Obama give them shotguns and weapons with 10 round clips or does he think the Syrians deserve to defend themselves with better weapons than Americans should have.

the dems sure love spending other peoples money

We supported rebels in Egypt. What happened? We lost a strong mid-east ally. We supported rebels in Lybia. What happened? Lybia is supplying guns to everyone in Africa. You would think we'd learn, just because a dictator is displaced doesn't mean the replacement is going to like us. The Syrian rebels consist of five groups. Who thinks at the end of the rebellion they are going to get along? Remember what happened to the Bolsheviks after the rebellion?

idiot engle is one of the reasons like obama amerika is hated...he stupidly wants to arm rebels in a syrian civil war that are more of a threat to israel and america than assad

Let me gets this straight...libs want to arm people in other countries and yet want to disarm Americans...whose side are they on any ways?Keep your nose out of other people's business. The POLITICIAN'S that are in DC are air heads, both PARTIES. Genius take care of our own CITIZEN'S before you help others. Here we have an IDIOT that wants to take guns away from LAW ABIDING AMERICAN CITIZEN'S , but wants to give weapons to TERRORISTS. No tours of the WHITE HOUSE because we don't have the money to pay for the tours.   They can find money to give weapons to these TERRORISTS in the MIDDLE EAST that HATE OUR GUTS! Let the other ARAB states give them weapons.

The democrats have a mental problem on spending they think money grows on tree and don't see the real picture that money comes out of ever AMERICAS wallet and even our children's piggy bank so AMERICA remember this 2014 and 2016 or more will come out of your wallet and the kids piggy bank!!!!!!!!

Well maybe if Mr Engel is so riled up maybe he should grab his gun and head for Syria!

Next they will vote to send in troops, then blame it on Bush or the Republicans.  Why can't OPEC take care of things over there.  We are broke and they want to send money to more Muslim Rebels who would spit on the flag and kill Americans just for the heck of it.  Enough is enough, let these people settle their own b.s. or kill each other off trying.I am so sick of the #$%$ out of Washington it isn't even funny.  They cut our military, kicking out troops right and left yet send money borrowed from China (who keeps hacking us) to these middle eastern Muslims.

Let's see if we cut the House members pay and benefits to that of Social Security recipients we may save enough to give away! I can fix the budget!

Democrats: Warmongers?!?!

There are no Muslim groups out there that will be friends with us.  The only answer is to become energy independent then leave the area and let them kill themselves.

Taking gun rights from Americans the shipping tons of them to the "rebels" who months ago have been found not to be the liberty loving student types, but a mix of Al Quaida, Hamas, and every other Islamic militant in the region fighting to bring the Muslim Brotherhood to power there. We have been fed a lie on who these "freedom fighters" are, it was the same thing in Libya, the same in Egypt, and the liberals are tying to make sure it happens in Syria, an Islamic Caliphate which will destabilize the middle east worse than it is and put the Saudi's next which will be caught between the African Al Quaida and the Muslim extremists on the other side. Worst foriegn policy decisions I've seen since Carter.

Is it me or do the Socialist Democrats look more and more like the same George Bush they screamed about being a war monger?

that would authorize Washington to provide assistance "including limited lethal equipment" to 'carefully vetted members of the Syrian opposition, aides and activists aware of Engel's plans said on Sunday.' Let me get this straight. So we say, 'Here Abdul, this is YOUR machine gun and YOUR rocket launcher, but don't you let anyone kill you and take them away.' Does anyone at all in D.C. have a brain that functions?amazing how a liberal progressive is a warmonger when a dem is president ... realy?

Wait, you mean the same rebels who are shooting people dead in the streets, much like the Assad regime? The way each side has acted, we should stand back and figure out how to deal with this country when the smoke clears.

Who wants to bet they are already sending lethal aid? They are just looking for approval now....

I'm a little tired of giving money to Muslims.

Don't give them any of those "imploding bullets" that Dianne Feinstein was ranting about, or any "assault" weapons.

The Obama administration gave guns to Mexican Drug Cartels, arms to Al Quida, Hamas and Muslim Brotherhood terrorists in Libya and lost Stinger Missiles they can't find, now they want to give military aid to more Muslims who hate America??!!  There is your "Hope and Change" America!

Seems this congressman has a friend in the arms business. Not one damn penny in any sort of aid to any foreign country till we get a ballanced budget, secure OUR borders and clean up our own back yard !

How about asking the taxpayers how they feel about spending money in the Mid East when we are cutting back on Border Patrol and releasing criminals waiting for deportation. Frigging traitors!

Engel, a Jew, wants to arm people who will use those weapons against Israel when and if the rebels win. We are becoming our own worst enemy.

Not No, but Hell No. Don't give these so-called rebels Or Assad ANY weapons. Muslim Jihadists have taken over the revolution just as they did in Egypt. These weapons would eventually be used against us and Europe. Have these politicians gone insane? STAY OUT OF SYRIA! HELP AMERICANS FIRST!Guess he didn't get the memo. Obama has been training and outfitting Syrian rebels for some time now in Jordan.

Any fight in that part of the world inevitably boils down to a fight between Sunni and Shia.  The West should have learned by now to stay out of those 7th century feuds.

ali obama closes the white house for tours because of money but can arm these terroisets with tax payers money,something is very wrong with this mad man.and the rest of the democraps.

Lethal aid=military industrial complex profits.  Go figure.

everyone need's to write and call Eliot Engel to stop this...we know for a fact they are terrorists do not support them! How dare they while we must cut back they give away our money to hostile nations..

why are dems only anti-war when a republican is in office?

If you took a poll, how many Americans would favor this type of action? I'm sick of these politicians not listening to the will of the vast majority of this country who do not want to get involved in more wars.

So Engels wants to arm Al Qaeda. After tensions escalate along the Golan, Engels will then insist that American troops be injected into the meat grinder. The entire charade if for MORE American intervention.

If Bohner said this the left-wing lapdog media would go wild. But since it's Obama it''s fine.

Obama found a song he likes... Money Burns A Hole In My Pocket – Dean Martin (1954)How long is it going to take the Dumbocrats to realize anytime you give money and/or arms to any country in the Middle East they will use it against us?

And let dear leader komrad obama sponsor another war? What a dunce.

Why is there always money for supporting Muslims but none for American kids that want to tour the White House?

If we support these guys, we are creating a new set of bad ones.  It is time for them to solve their own problems.  let's get our Military home and let them solve thier problems.  Enough is enough.  If we are not going to win, then time to leave.

It seems that war is not a partisan issue at all.  The dems are trying to get the US active in teh syrian conflict.

Dems are against wars but cannot help themselves when it comes to giving someone something.

Why is it the ones who the most against weapons and war are wanting to give waepons for a war?

Yet he is all for taking the arms from law abiding US citizens. Hypocrite anyone?

Sure thing Engel, just spend some of your own money. Not tax payer money.

i want to shake the mans hand that is smart enough to tell the difference in the rebels and syrian troops and al quida and turks and saudies and lybians and iranians and clans from iraq and can sort all out.we cannot tour the wh our veterans can't go to school and we DAMN WELL CANNOTAFFORD TO GIVE MORE WEAPONS TO MUSLIMS

Now if that was  GOP person saying this. Obama would be putting on another one of his dog and pony shows. To bad mouth the GOP

How Ironic. Most of America wants to use lethal force on every pos Democrat in Washington.

It's not that we don't WANT to give Syria any arms.It's that we just can't seem to get Mexico to give back to us first.

We really don't know who the bad guys are and it is not our business. We are already in  more than enough countries that hate us.

Looks like the Democrats believe the 2nd Ammendment applies to everone on the planet except Americans.

they done got our cash what more do they want

The problem is how do you tell who the "good guys" are?

When are we going to accept the fact that we as a country can't become involved in every conflict around the world.  We are broke, but now that liberals are in power it is just fine with  them to continue spending money we just don't have.  These countries will be in some type of conflict as long as time exist.

NO! No boots on the ground in Syria.If we arm them, it is only a matter of time before they are used against us. Besides, we don't have the money. Our government needs to stop wasting our money.

Want to limit our guns but want to arm 'rebels' made up for god knows who whom we have to fight later on anyway..

And then, 10 years from now, when Syrians bomb the Empire State Building, we can go to war in another worthless desert, fighting enemies who are using the guns we gave them a decade earlier.

We are broke, what is it the democrats don't understand about broke. Give them aid and we will be fighting against our own weapons in 2 years.

How about that, another Democrat wants to give your TAX dollars away.....

so you Disarm Americans and give gun to terroists...that makes sense.....

How about this, screw every other country but ours.

So arming rebels is O.K. as long as the lefties want it?

Eliot Engel:   please tell me the difference between your desire for gun control in the U.S. and your intent of providing guns to rebels on foreign soil?   You do understand that the citizens of the US or any country are ultimately rebels for their freedoms, liberty and protection of rights against a government that might become overly oppressive?

"Lethal Aid"...hmmm, another word for WAR?!Engel wants gun control here in the USA but wants to make weapons available to rebels in Syria????   Is this a contradiction in theory?   #$%$?

Bama wants to start a World war, and historically this is what always happens when the economy is failing.  After the next 911 type style attack and its going to happen and it will be a false flag.  fist they have to get the guns and thats not going to happen no matter what law they pass or what the supreme court rules.

Sequester cuts on Americans=arms to Syrian terrorists.

How many more civilians will be killed for nothing.  Assad is not going anywhere.  He's backed by the RUSSIANS.  Get over it.

then you pay for it  leave the taxpayers money alone

Stay the hell out of their business.Who cares what government they set up,they'll be overthrowing that one too in a couple of more years.

we are all tightening our belts as this administration continues to "make it rain".

Of course obama wants wants to help Syria kill e everyone in Israel Hitler wanted all the Jews dead too.

We should give the Assad regime unlimited 16 ounce Slurpees, that will do them in for sure.

Let's mind our own business, it's their war. Also their is known Al Qaeda fighting against the Serian Government. Besides how can we send them more aid when we can't even afford to keep White House tours going due to "spending cuts."THIS GUY IS A LEFT WING LOON.........LIKE OBAMA

Write down the names of the politicians who want us to get involved in this conflict. When the sh-t hits the fan, we'll know who to go to!

Why in the world would a thinking person arm islamics? We all know from experience that they will turn against us and use those arms to fight us.What was this democrat thinking???

I guess I will never understand Washington and those in power.  They are fighting tooth and nail to disarm law abiding Americans and in the next breath they want to arm people that hate us and pray for our down fall. This goes on right out in the open and people still think Washington care about Americans..

This is exactly why DEMORATS don't deserve to be in office....they have no sense of obligation to the AMERICAN CITIZEN.

there they go again. countries who will kill us when they get the chance. no big deal though, our politicians are doing it for them already

So arming rebels is O.K. as long as the lefties want it?

Anyone besides me remember Viet Nam ?   Aid=Advisors=Troops=DEAD AMERICANS !!!

It appears that Barack Hussein and the Democrats wants to support Al-Qaeda terrorist Muslim rebels in Syria...

Those damn fugging Republican War Mongers !   Ooops my bad.NO!!!  Do not arm our future enemies.

Why don't we send them a couple of cases of MREs, handy-wipes and Bibles?  Okay, okay..throw in a case of Twinkies.

Mistake !  I'm all for wiping out muslims but Egypt and Libya have proved the replacement is worse than what was there.  Besides they're not gonna like us anymore if we did help,

Genocide, and depopulation stem from every demonkraut decision. Or is it called humanicide, or, just plain SATAN

Why do they want to wade into those waters, when our own waters need attention?We have seen this movie before and it always ends with increasing involvement and eventually an economy devastating war.

So, we don't have money for tours of the White House, but we do have money to send weapons across the world to strangers?  Makes sense.

Less money for the freeloaders at home... I am sure Obama will tax us more to cover his spending.

Forget that, we need the money......pay down the debt Obama!

no way they cannot pass gun laws /arms may endup in the hands of nut cases and young teens/ besides they want to gave them eivil assault rifkes

i have been reading the democrat's comments on how it is the republicans who want to get  the US involved in too many wars ( or police actions) the senior dem. wants us to send aide to syria .first off why do we need to spend our money there ? WE ARE BROKE at least us regular people are . keep our money and arms here . second the dems  will have to work hard to blame that FUTURE fiasco on BushWould someone remind them what happen in Lybia, what a bunch of #$%$.

No Problem....Obama will just go over there and they can all hold hands and sing "Kum-BY-Ah", and "We are the world"..........Then everybody will make nice togather..

Charity begans at home!!

No More Aid to Syria ,gave 195 Million Shuty down Foreign Aid Period !!!

so let me get this straight.we are going to give them guns, to end the blood shed.this is the thinking that astounds me!

our elected officials have the common sense of a fresh turd.

More Liberal 'true colors'. They don't mind supporting terrorists, just so long as it's 'their' terrorists. Obama loves the 'right' terrorists, he just calls them 'freedom fighters', even after they attack Americans.

Further proof that democrats hate America. It is treason to give "aid and comfort" to the enemy. This is Al Qaeda that they want to arm, and last I heard they were our enemy.

Don't worry everyone: "Our debt is sustainable..." Barack Obama

Politicians want to limit gun rights of Americans and increase them to people in other countries? Thats like saying lesser bullets in magazines will save lives. What, people don't know how to change a magazine?  You  meat head politicians!!  It takes 3 seconds to change a magazine in a pistol. Who's life is  going to be saved in 3 seconds?  Certainly not the political lives of poiticians who aid in stealing the average american's gun rights.Forget it, stay out of Syria and worry about home!!!

Send Feinstein, Kerrry, Cuomo, Bloomberg, Biden, Clinton,Boxer, Schumer, on a fact finding mission.

I sure hope this is a sick joke, all we have heard is the doom and gloom of the sequester, and now we are going to give aid to those who would attack us in a heartbeat. Sure sounds like good sound policy, typical of this administration.

good theory Engel.....and maybe one day the Syrian rebels can return the guns to the citizens of the United States when our legislators have taken all of our gun rights away.

Typical play-on words "lethal" &amp; "aid" put in one word. Politicians are professional liars, manipulators &amp; cons..anywhere they may be...but especially American officials.

NO NO NO &amp; H3LL to the NO.......NO More Arming, Training or Giving Away out Hard earned tax Dollars to....Tired of Throwing Money Out the window,,so these Muslim Terrorist can Kill Us Later~!!!

"... carefully vetted members of the Syrian opposition." Unreal. You really can't make it up. It's just too embarrassingly stupid.

Yep, aid and comfort to our enemies.

We as American's should be able to own and have the same type of full automatic M4 rifle our U.S. military currently uses.   And that is what the 2nd Amendment framers intended from the start.   Just as Sweden and Israel require their citizens to own and have full automatic weapons for their homeland defense in case of attack from a foreign and domestic enemy.

You send aid to those Muslims today, you could be beheaded tomorrow! Why can't the government learn lessons from the past? Don't waste tax payer money.What is it about the middle east conflict that representative Engel thinks he has an inside edge on how to proceed?  Representative Engel needs to FOCUS on US military needs andnot a undisciplined statement of discord by the Syrian rebel opposition.  In the discussion of the Arab Spring forget the adage the enemy of my enemy is my friend.  It doesn't work in thisscenario and to think it does is foolishness.

They can't afford to keep illegal aliens in jail but can afford to send arms to Syria?  What's wrong with this picture?

There must be a homosexual in the bunch.

I quit obiding by any law that a Democrat passed years ago. They can all drop dead as far as I'm concerned.

If a Republican had propsed this,, it would be on the Marquee,, with "Warmonger" underneath.

Hey Folks, are there good Muslims out there that oppose the bad guys?

Per Article 3 Section 3 of the CONSTITUTION, supplying the Syrian rebels with anything constitutes TREASON. The Syrian rebellion is composed of Al-Qaeda which we are at war with.

Let them shoot it out!  Who cares!

I thought it was Republicans that wanted to get involved in wars!!!

maybe they could provide them with their body gas. or all the worthless #$%$ that comes out of their mouths.Why can't we just stay out of this one? If they win we will just be arming another radical Islamist state, because that's what Syria will become.

But, the magazines will hold no more than seven rounds, and the issued persons will have to submit to background checks, and firearms training.  In addition they will have to register their firearms and keep them at home since they have already eaten or killed all the animals.  Members of congress implementing this law will travel to Syria and make sure only "approved", "selected", and "vetted" members of the opposition receive these weapons.  Just like they did in Afghanistan, South Viet Nam, Iraq, Yemen, Somalia, Mexico.  Pass the puke bucket.

Wouldn't you think they would be more concerned with planes falling out of the air, cops on the street, little school kids visiting the White House. Strange Americans these Democrats are.

Democrats got money for Syria but not our military.  Keep spending money we do not have.. go democrats..

So Obama , the poodle is going to visit fake Apartheid genocidal terrorist Netanayahoo  Israel with it's NUKES ? (stolen or not from USA)  Yet argues to disarm USA. You cannot make this stuff up.

Another dumb idea by the dumb bells in Washington. They have zero idea who the "rebels" are or what they stand for. Be careful what you wish for.

How about we give aid to all the federal workers that your furloughing before sending anymore money overseas?

Sending Arms overseas while they want to take away ours at home. Good Grief. Haven't we learned anything since Iraq, Libya, Eqypt, etc etc. There is no helping over there. We just make new enemies.

The very same donkeycraps that are pushing to escalate U.S. involvement in a radical Islamic takeover of Syria are the same ones that ridicule our involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. Only difference is Bush was trying to push radical Islamists out, and Obama and the donkeycraps are trying to get them in.

Idoits want us in a warThe senior Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee is pushing President Barack Obama's administration to train and arm some Syrian rebels, in addition to providing humanitarian assistance.( American foreign policy and middling is what starts wars at tax payers expense. These politicians need to step down or be fired from their positions. The American people should vote on every tax laws to foreign policy to assistance in every state. Do away with the politicians having the final vote. )

For once,the Prez is making the decision, for now.

NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, and NO. the people in the US first.

As soon as Assad is gine,these weapons will beturned on us just like Bengazi.

Here's your answer.....NO and HELL NO!!

It's OK! they're Democrats.  They know what they are doing, and how to fight a war without getting their hands dirty.  They arm bad guys all of the time.  They want to give Syrian rebels automatic weapons, and at the same time try and take semi automatic weapons from their fellow Americans.  All part of their big plan.

The Demo-crates should be as quick to aid American Citizens...such as the Sandy disaster victims (In Example)...but Noooooo billions for those who HATE US is their Agenda.

Not sure if the Senator missed the recent article that the Rebels have been executing captured soldiers.  Giving them any aid, especially "lethal" is just not the right thing to do at this point.

When will the Democrats realize that we're broke and in some serious debt? All they want to do is spend spend spend.

After 50000 people died.Blood is on Obamas hands and is forever.Maybe the federal government shutting down would be a good thing.

I suggest we mind our own business. We can always use missile defence when the nukes go flying.

Another plan to provide them with assault weapons just like they did the cartels.

I though we do not negotiate with terrorists? They have kidnapped UN soldiers, tried smuggling weapons INTO Lebanon, and who knows what.Let them fight it out amongst themselves, it is not like we have such a good track record in Libya, Afghanistan, Iraq. No more wasting American soldiers lives. I though OBAMA was bringing home the troops and not starting any more wars for the US?

stay the $#%$#@$ away from this situation!

NO!

House Republicans killed a bill last week to raise minimum wage to 10.10 dollars an hour and now House Democracts want to give Syria money. What a sick Country we live in

Round up the gangs in L.A., Chicago, Detroit, and other infested cities, and send them to help the Syrian rebels.......

Why do fools in Congress want to spend our money overseas, when this country is hurting?  We got "sequestered", we have budget problems that Congress and the Pres. can't come together on, and this yahoo wants to not only misuse our $, but get us involved in yet another war!  #$%$

Will arm them then they also will turn on us just like every other country we help. Cant believe someone hasnt took Assah out already but there all waiting for the Us to do it so they have another reason for revenge against us.Maybe we can give them all the weapons people turn in that they say they have lolDont the Democrat know that guns kill?

{"It is time for us to develop a comprehensive approach to stopping the carnage,"}Yep, more weapons oughta do it.

Demons if you need to turn illegals loose because of budget cuts you don't have the money to buy guns for Syrian rebels.  Get the picture Jackasses.

I supposed the wellbeing of Americans is not as important as DC warmongers' self-interest in their global agenda which is dropping the 1st domino (Syria) which will weaken Hezbollah, Iran &amp; by extension North Korea..securing Israel &amp; a bonus of affecting the Chinese &amp; Russian economies &amp; spheres of influence.

ElIdiot Engel

McCain needs to be put out to pasture,,,,He has done enough damage,,,,,forty years ago he was a different person.

Eliot Engel,how about telling your Buddy NutnYahoo to stop the Illegal Settlements in Israel and give Palestinians their Homeland,that will stop 99% of the problems in the Middle East and elswhere in the world.

swell idea teach them to kill us, we have fools working for us

Does everyone know now how ridiculous the Obama administration and the democrats in Congress are?

Stay out of another chit hole, let Russia handle it!Help our troops we can't even beat the Flinstones in Afghanistan !

Why does the united states continue to arm their future enemies?

Maybe Elliot Engel should lead by example, go over and spear head an attack.

America has become so disenfranchised.. Our politicians could care less about the good of its own people. Boot 'em all and never let them back in again.

Funny - the Democrats want to arm citizens of other countries, but try to take our weapons away from us.

We in our best interest need to stay out of this mess, enough is enough..............

The only lethal aid they should get from us is the plague and maybe jock itch.

It is not our country's responsibility to police the world. Let all those other mid eastern countries police their own. Why are these idiots asking for us to arm those who will become our enemies and bring further instability to the mid east? Take care of our own first, and the best thing they can do to help at home is to resign enmass. Our government creates far more problems than it solves and so far Obama has done a great job of dividing this country's people. It's about the only thing he has done.

President disaster.  What the hell is this guy doing.  Spending our money replacing dictators with Muslim radicals.

Obama Sucks!Thumbs up if you agree.What will Engel do when weapons are eventually used against Israel?

I am the poster child of liberal thinking and to this I say, not just no, but hell no!

I work all night, I work all day, to pay the bills I have to payAin't it sadAnd still there never seems to be a single penny left for meThat's too badIn my dreams I have a planWe got to get rid of the Obama manI wouldn't have to work at all, I'd be a democrat and all...Abba, Money Money Money..

Eliot Engel why don't you just take ur #$%$ over there and fight yourself if you care that much about it

As if Republican was the only party that likes to add fuel to a blazing fire...

NO MORE WAR BY THE DEMONS.  OBAMA IS THE DEVIL.

Does anyone care, what we the people want, or don't want? Note to the IDIOTS in Washington, we do not want more war and more spending. Can't you hear us?

What A Moron - Arming Terrorist Rebels Who HATE America ..........................If this is the Best America Has in the House - We Need To Have Our Heads Examined because You Idiots Voted This Bucket Of TRASH in Office !

So a New York Democrat Congressman wants to give lethal aid to a foreign country's rebels, while other Democrats in New York want to infringe on America's rights to bear arms.  How stupid is this? Just say NO!!!!

The President is trying to make a NWO seema like with him the boss.Cut our own military spending so that we can beefed up the so called rebels today and will be terrorist in the next year or so....................What an idiot!Liberals Democrats been wrong with Egypt and libya so far.....................

Dems are always more than willing to give away other people's money.

Stay the F out of it liberals!!! and we are pro-military ex military etc, you start this we will be dragged into this, if you want this so bad, give up your ar-15's and send them right over or your own #$%$ money you idiots.

Eliot should deliver the goods and stay there..is Eliot out of his f........g mind?

The Mexicans are a bigger problem !

I thought democrats are opposed to guns?

no arms they cannot  pass a back ground check arms may fall into the hands of nut cases

Arm the Syrians but for the good of our country take away our rights to defend ourselves. It's a pretty weird double standard by the Dems don't you think?

let them alone, it will all wash out in time

This is a bad idea..we should stay out of it !!!!Stop helping people outside the U.S.!! Help our OWN and ONLY our own!!!

if we cant fund tours at the white hos how can we fund syria ,

sending arms to the muslem brotherhood,obama's buddies

Why cant these amahooes pay attention to our own boarders, our own American welfare what the hell happened with our leaders Patriotism ?

We have plenty of problems in the Middle East, plenty of our own making.  We've been here before, looks like we really want to continue our losing streak in the region.  History is an excellent guide, but one has to read and understand it.  Our leadership has apparently never cracked a history text.

We should not give aid to anyone until we can pay for our own expenses.  Maybe they should try passing a budget for starters.  Democrats want to take arms away from US citizens yet pay to arm other countries that are full of people that hate us.  Makes perfect sense.

NO!

Why the hell dont we start giving some "humanitarian assistance" to our own people!!!!!!!!!!!

Representative Engel has signed on to disarm American citizens-google his record-yet he wants to arm Syrian rebels. Why isn't this mentioned in the article... yes we all know why.

Sounds good lets sell them all the captured arms from Iraq, and Afghanistan..That's what Obama gave Libya, then we had to send in special CIA to try to buy back weapons that ended up in the wrong hands.  Obviously lessons were not learned.

Why do we pay our bills first? US first, everyone else go away.

Who will aid the American freedom fighters if this happen in our back yard?Any responses?

Let the Syrians and their neighbors figure this out....we do not need to stick our noses into a middle eastern civil war...where has common sense gone???

Dear American citizens, Democrats, Republicans, Libertarians, we must stand up and demand America FIRST!!! IT IS TIME TO REMOVE MAJORITY OF OUR POLITICIANS AND REPLACE THEM WITH COMMON SENSE AMERICA FIRST ATTITUDE POLITICIANS AND PREVENT AMERICA FROM BANKRUPCY...  JOHN McCain, Lindsey Graham, Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, John Boehner, Harry Reid, Joe Biden, ETC... MUST BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE NEVER TO RETURN. WHY DO WE KEEP ELECTING THE SAME CORRUPT PIECE OF #$%$ POLITICIANS? WE MUST BECOME INVOLVED AND MORE INFORMED ABOUT WHO WE VOTE IN OFFICE TO REPRESENT US!!! IF POSSIBLE IMPEACH OBAMA BEFORE HE TOTALLY BANKRUPTS AMERICA!!!

this is a bad idea.

Take our guns and give them to terrorists.

Not no but hell no we can't afford to help them and have no business doing so.

Deja vu

Don't worry the Leaches of the Liberal Democratic view will bleed us dry before we can change them out."Although he acknowledged there are risks to arming the rebels, Engel said providing military aid to Syria's opposition would bring the humanitarian disaster to an end and help ensure that the United States has a constructive relationship with Syria's new government after the end of Assad's rule." Yea, just like Egypt and Libya.

democrats have found a new hobby---are they tired of trying to take our guns away &amp; they want to get into some super nasty stuff--make sure that you send your kids or grand kids out to battle

What a stupid #$%$ h o l e. We are involved in one big rotten stupid war in Afghanistan and he's trying to involve us in another. Hanging by the neck might be to good for him?

IT'S THE DEMORAT'S PLAN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Why is the Department of Hommie Land Security who only answers to the  Prezeedent and is Unconstitutional, buying 2700 armored vehicles, stock piling billions of rounds of ammunition and lots of full auto M4 military rifles, military rifles we cannot own, while blue states attempt to disarm us all.

Impeach Washington D.C. would be a great start!!

Syrian rebels include al-Qaeda linked groups. I guess the US gov't now is cool with arming al-Qaeda. Great! When is the US going to learn to stop meddling everywhere? There's always blowback.

I guess the Nobel clowns jumped the gun when the gave oblameo that peace prize huh? What happened to the world peace that was to ensue from the community organizer being elected the first go around?

Here we go again !! Who in the hell is going to come to our aid when we cant pay our bills as a nation ??? answer no one  except china when they take over !!thanks obummer !!

giving lethal aid to end bloodshed, holy newspeak batmanGuns for Syrians and Democrats try to take away our guns.

I think Obama wants to act like he's against giving more weapons to muslim terrorists but really wants to and will. Why should he change any now. He's already done that several times. Can't be trusted, to many lies.

So Representative Eliot Engel  wants to give more aid to Al Quada?  Why, so they can blow up more of our skyscrapers?

This politician is clearly out of his mind - even politically supporting these rebels who associate with terrorists is pushing it, let alone with weapons. The humanitarian disaster is the responsibility of the people in Syria - Assad, the rebels and those aligned with them, and people who sit on the side lines to figure out a solution for this humanitarian mess, not other countries.

engel is a TOTAL idiot. Syrian rebels are militant MUSLIMS! America TIRED of war, broke, and needs to be FIXED at home. AMERICANS are fed up with money talks between a broken Congress and a LIAR president who wants the trifecta with his muslim brotherhood takeover in egypt, libya, and now syria. ENOUGH, IMPEACH THE LIAR owebuma soetoro!

Let Engel go and he can take McCain with him.

Why don't the dumbocrats just go over and fight the war. Then maybe with half the idiots gone from our country we can get our economy on track

They let illegals out of jail for no money, sequester our troops and their pay, but can give aid and guns/ammo to them? And want to take our guns away here at home?? Do you see why liberals are messed up beyound repair!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Careful vetting has worked so well in Afghanistan that now we are going to use it in Syria?

tell me this is a poor joke?Fast and furious all over again funny how they wana take away americans guns and wana arm other countries

all week long mainstream news will be the salesmen for this stupid waste of tax money !

confiscate them from Americans and give them to Syrians. Yeah, great job libbytards!

USA is directly supporting terrorism. And should be treated accordingly by law.

how much money arme companys gaving them to change their minds in campaion funds

I thought only republicans were war mongers..

Whats wrong with helping  your own people here that are in need or hurting...if you have the money to send over seas...keep it here and help AMERICA

How will they pay for it?  Maybe we could cut Congressional pay by 50%!!!!!Although it is funny, they already gave Egypt several military fighters and some tanks are on the way.

IDIOTS

Whichever Democrats want to support this can pay for it out of their own pockets. Not the taxpayers. Hows that?home frist! SOB's

gents, we have more pressing problems right here. or don't you think so? they can get all the weapons they want from the others in the area. maybe thats the problem. you can't think. all of you are getting $200.000 and al you can think about is getting more money from over there.

No aid! We have seen where this "Arab spring" eventually leads: to an islamic state predicated on possessing the only "Belief" the living should be allowed to possess.

Democrats want to sell weapons to our enemies to use against our own troops in the future.

Engel, Never heard of the guy, but he shot himself in the foot. Idiot!

Before we supply war supplies or invade any other countries... The politicians sons and daughters should be on the front line...

America get out of the war business. You haven't won since WW2. Stop the bullying. Stop the American hegemony of the world. Other countries deserve to rise and fall. Don't play a god in the worlds politics. Your own country is a mess. Try fixing that before taking over the world.

You mean Al Qaeda!   The Syrian rebels are Al Qaeda, working for the U.S.

Syria needs aid from thier nieghbvors and the rest of the world the U.S.A. Has given enough in the middle east.Time for the rest of the world to step up! What's the matter doen't Germany have any balls?How about France, How about the entier E.U.? Step back and watch the U.S. help and do nothing???? You slackers!!!

Republican War Bad--Dem War GoodThe Democrats want to take guns away from Americans. But want to arm people that hate us and would kill us it they get a chance. It's time to vote these people out of office.

This would be a bad idea that will come back to haunt us. This is not our fight.

give the money for tours

Haven't you Dems had enough of war yet?  You Dems are a bunch of warmongers!

we should be selling them weapons..not giving them weapons for free.

If Engel wants to aid the rebel jihadist terrorsits so badly, let him go to Syria himself and fight against the government, and leave our troops out of Al Qaeda's wars.

Kerry was a war demonstrator now a war monger.... Talk about flip-flop!

Yeah, give these terrorists most lethal weapon. They'll blow up Wall street with its help.

Just think how much better the U.S. would be if we ignored other countries that have been killing each other since the days of Jesus.Taking care of our own needy, our starving, our unemployed, our sick. War only if we are attacked and respond quickly and it's over quick.Only time we were united as a country was WWII.

Those think this is right thing to do to train them and provide lehal equipment/s  with guranteed under oth that it will not acct like those as Pakistani? from thos GOP and Democrate suppoerting this idea ?Rather let them solved themselve..HELL NO.  These same 'rebels' will be chanting 'death to america' several times a week as soon as Asad is gone.

Not only no but hell no!

"but Obama has so far refused to give them arms, arguing that it is difficult to prevent the weapons from falling into the hands of militants who could use them against Western targets."Obama made a point for once

The worst thing that we(USA) can do is give arms training and weapons to Syria rebel because they are Islamic  and will only turn on the USA as Turkey, Egypt, Afghanistan and the Palestinian. We should like them Finn for themselves and kill one another off. A god Muslim is a dead Muslim.

Eliot Engel and likes of this moron are the reason why Al Qaida will never be destroyed.

Another member of the Israel lobby encouraging American into middle east entanglements.

I thought we didn't have any money? If we can afford tourists, we can't afford this. Unless...the guns they are trying to take away from citizens they want to give to the "rebels".

HI, youm idiots we need money here home america, don't be a jackass, although you all are fools. no brainers.

Eliot Engel, Khazar Judaist and shrill for AIPAC wants to blow Syria off the map using our tax dollars; does this surprise anybody?????  Please throw Engel out of our country!!!!!

Wow .. the US government wants to not allow millitary style weapons in the hands of US civilians but want to give it to the so called rebels aka Al Ciada....pathetic hypocritesDidn't you CLOWNS learn ANYTHING the last couple times you backed the Muslim "rebels"?!?!?!? Here's one simple message- KEEP YOUR NOSES OUT OF IT AND FOCUS ON FIXING AMERICA!!!!!

Stay out of middle east messes...haven't we learned anything from the Bush years?

I don't think the US should contribute lethal aid to any party in any conflict, especially in the Middle East.

And the reasoning to support the rebels is what? Is it the enemy of my enemy is my friend? Bin Laden was the enemy of our enemy at one time. Foolish.

The US is waking up to the realities in Syria. Supply of military assistance to the selected groups in the Syrian opposition army is a humanitarian assistance to prevent more deathe and reduce the future cost of other humanitarian assistance to the refugees and internally displaced persons (IDP). The US has already spent about $500 million for humanitarian assistance to refugees and IDPs.How long the US can afford to spend like this in the midst of sequestration. France and UK are taking up the leadership role in supplying military assistance to Syrian rebels while President Obama is enjoying a nap. Supplying anti-aircraft guns and missiles and anti-tank weapons will help the rebel army to impose the no-fly zone in Syria without any other military involvement of US, EU. or NATO.

Hey got a better idea let us keep the monies and feed the poor in America...obama muslim suc assp...

Good news for the terrorist groups in Africa. Big donation from US is coming soon.

All I can say is you people elected them so suffer...

Who's going to help the civil war that is going to erupt in this country?

So bush was a war mongerer for being part of 2 conflicts, how many has this president had his hands in, why do democrats love war so much????????????????????Our Non lethal aid killed 70,000 innocent civilians in Syria. I suppose that is not enough. With lethal aid we want to kill 700,000.Is there any  limit to our killings of innocent civilians and children?Inquisitive minds like to know.

If they want to fight their government they should do it with their own resources.

Stay the hell out of Syria. Don't let US taxpayers get stuck with the reconstruction of that country.

Looks like another Jew politician trying to instigate more wars.

Is the author of this piece on drugs or does he think we are all on drugs?  A few points1.  We are going through a financial crisis (again) in this country, we don't have the money to help.  Don't borrow it, don't print it, just say no.  For the near sighted politician that is spelled NO!2.  Sending military aid to the rebels would bring the humanitarian disaster to an end and ensure the US would have a constructive relationship with the new syrian government.  Wow that makes sence, unless you apply that same logic (which our government did) to the wars in Iraq and afghanistan.  We helped end the hostilities by bombing their cities and civilian populations.  We provided money clothes and humanitarian care.  We rebuilt the infrastructure, buildings and even spent alot of money building projects that they never wanted nor asked for. We also help maintain the piece by sending drones in to kill off the opposition, and oh sorry about the innocents.  Collateral damage,ya know.3.  They hate us, want us out of their countries.  They are giving the oil contracts, which is why we really went there, to other countries businesses.  They got what they wanted from us, now they point fingers at us and call us devils.  And really somone got what they wanted too. The fat cats got the contracts to rebuild what we the tax payer payed to tear down.  Yep somone made alot of money telling us our lives and country were in jeopardy.And whats funny is they keep doing it, and most of you keep believing the lie.4.  I remember as a child the stories coming out world war II about american companies selling steel and munitions to germany.  Germany turned the steel into tanks and airplanes and used them to kill Americans and innocents from allied nations. Most people with a sence of honor and high moral fiber were apalled at this transgression.  The citzens called for investigations into these traitorius actions.  The reults showed that some of our richist and most powerful businessmen were behind the sales.  Need I say that the charges went away and because of spinning the news these traitors continued to prosper.  Need I say more?

For a political party that is full of hippies, liberals and beatniks, they sure are warmongering, bloodthirsty tree-huggers.

How do these idiots get elected.  War and killing never solve any problems.  Where are the man of peace.

Just let China send the money directly to Syria - and then send the BILL to us.That's essentially what he is saying.  Constantly borrowing money we don't have.

wait, you mean the syrian branch of al-CIA-duh is running out of weapons to slaughter people with? cant let syria use its own currency to buy and sell oil, got to use the fiat petro dollar, even as it sinks, or the US will invade you too...errr al-CIA-duh will fund and participate in an uprising near you.looks like they are just about finished with the list of 7 nations they wanted destroyed 20 years ago, now they want to tuff talk north korea and china. just stop barry o-bomb-a, no more troops on the ground, no more drone strikes killing innocents, no more infringement on my rights...NDAA 2013, Patriot Act, FISA, HR 569, HR 347, HR 3166, S 1698, these are all or in part directly against the rights of persons, these rights are not given by the constitution, but protected by it. repeal all unconstitutional laws/edicts/EO now.

It is so sad our elected official makethere motto to get elected by making to die and suffer and make our young men and wmen as handicaped to die for Israel aor any other nation,, Are they in market to sell own soul to foreign Nation/s? like to hear from those wanting to ne next contender for US President.And why does the USA want to become involved?Reuters very rarely informs the public that:--  According to The Oil and Gas Journal, as of January 1, 2010, Syria's proven natural gas reserves were estimated at 8.5 trillion cubic feet (Tcf), about half of which is associated gas. Non-associated gas reserves are mainly located in the east and center of the country. Roughly 35 percent of Syrian natural gas production was reinjected into oilfields in 2008, about 2 percent was vented or flared, and the rest distributed to power generators and other domestic users.- Syria plans to substitute natural gas for oil in all of its domestic power generation and industrial use by 2014. Over half of Syria's power generating facilities are still fueled by refined oil products, much of which must be imported due to inadequate refining capacity.. . . and that little, and mostly unreported fact is WHY.

Bullpuckyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy  they better not be arming nobody with nothing!!!!!!! They don't want us to have our guns? This is a joke right? Its fake posting right?  Anyways if its not no way shape or form should they be giving any more help to anybody PERIOD!!!!!!!!!!! THIS IS GETTING OLD REAL FAST!!!!!!!!!!!!!

OBAMA AND DEMS SENDS MOOLAH?  The senior Democrat on the U.S. House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee found $60 million dollars out of continuing resolution authority funds or current revenue and wants to send it to Syria where it would do most good to help the American taxpayers who have not had an approved budget for the past three years.  We should think the rightful Democrat Rep. Engel send some of his hard earned Congressional pay to help these Egyptians out of their current mess.  Wait let's see what his constituency has to say back home about his generosity? I'm frankly concerned that we should mind our own business and keep our money?

Bad idea!

How about helping hurting Americans first?

Stay the hell out of this.  we as americans have had enough of this #$%$.  this is a story that will play itself out without any help from us.

and how much of this money is coming from our tax dollars, and #$%$ don't we have American who need health care and medicine, wow what have we become when america comes second to others who hate our country and our illegal

Stupid idea.....

Hey Engel, I know let's volunteer your body and money you coward. I guess the 120,000 dead iraqi's wasn't enough for you eh? Yeah, it is terrible what is going on in Syria but it is none of our business. I am frankly sick and tired of you Crongressmen and women who intervene in everyone's business in the world instead of just simply representing your district.

there was a time when Osama BinLaden was on our side during the Russia Afghanistan warMore weapons for the Muslim Brotherhood. More cash for Obama's friends.

For a bunch of old hippie anti war anti violence peaceniks, these liberal/communist/progressive/democrats sure do like to start wars.  The Obama seems a weee bit psycotic when it comes to playing his real life video games.

well at least we have pledged non leathal aide. send some of the congressmen over with their fat wallets and let them aide syria themselves

First question we should be asking is who the hell is the leader of these rebels?

How many Christians are fighting with the terrorists aka "rebels" ZERO... Racist religious pigs

Arm the world's rebels? Somebody is not practicing what they preach and the left calls conservatives hypocrites!!!

NO,NO,NO!!!!!!!!!!!! It just came out today that the U.S. Involvement in Iraq has lasted 10 years, cost 3.9 trillion dollars, and cost 5,000 american soldiers lives, and many more injured. And for what? Didn't our Govt. learn from Viet Nam and Iraq? Stay out of Syria and the entire Middle East.

is that idioe engle talking. how are u gonna train a selected few. kidnap them saying u are the chozen few. get real idiot

One more instance to show how J-e-w-i-s-h congressman keep pushing for wars in Near East.  Engle wants even more killing of Arabs - this time Syrians.  Divide and conquer - it seems to be working according to Netanyahu and Obama's plans: Egypt; Libya; Iraq; Syria; Sudan; Somalia; Lebanon.  Only Saudi Arabia and Kuwait - our governments cohorts in crime - are immune.  Neo-cons are working overtime.

yeah right.. arm the rebels.. we should be for the other guy..Our politicians can't win a war !

Hey I'm sure Pres. Dumb and V.Pres. Dumber know what they're doing, right? After all, they are the intellegencian, the elite.....They both know about war....since they both served, right?

Israel can't trick us into fighting any more of their wars, so now they just want taxpayers to pay for their MERCENARIES.

cant afford a white house tour yet we can afford this?

Again we are supporting the wrong side.  At least Assad protects the Christian in his country.  Once we let the Brotherhood in there will be a massacre of Christians.

We can arm the Syrian rebels when pigs fly.  In the mean time, pay down our debt.

Does this surprise anyone? Take away our guns, give them guns? Borrow money from China and send it to them, good plan. Keep it up and you can have obama on the deal

all the dems want is to spend more money on other countries....while increasing our taxes..and cutting money to americans....

Kennedy must be turning in his grave to see Obama who he help become president and his cohorts reps catering to the military, and his ME oil and land grabbing sugar daddies at the expense of our economy and our people

"drone" the halfbreed (Not even a real black MAN) marxist coward HATE America traitor FILTHArming the extremist groups will make the situation worse. What a lunatic.

Aren't the Liberal, Progressive Democrats anti war and that's why Geneva awards so many of them the Nobel Peace for PEACE. Oh, I forgot this so called Lethal Aid is suppose to support another Muslim Countries Arab Spring and they could care less about American values and our Christian ways but their our friends.

So we americans can't have the right to have a gun, but some total strangers on the other side of the globe not only can have them but now we will pay for it? Is this the twilight zone or what? While we get robed blind by our own leaders, they want to give others rights that they don't want us to have and pay for it with our money? F...ing crazy.

I love it! Take guns away from americans and give them to muslums who will use them to kill americans.

dont give them chit,it willbe used aginst us soon

Eliot Engel is just another Zionazi war monger.Deport him.

Its an Insult to arm foreign rebels with our tax money.

US citizens want the government to stop sending funds/arms to these countries who hate us.

they are just being DemocRATS

I wonder what the record is for most people killed by a Nobel Peace Prize winner is?"The push by Engel, a New York Democrat, which comes days before Obama is due to visit the Middle East, could strengthen the resolve of some U.S. legislators to do more to end the bloodshed in Syria."  If Engel and others in Congress want to give lethal assistance to Syrian rebels, then they should all be on the front line handing out those weapons.  When innocent people are killed or the weapons fall into the wrong hands, We the People will know who to blame.  It's easy to say that lethal assistance is necessary when you are insulated from war in your cozy mansion with all your lobbyist money that you freely spend on lavish gifts for yourself and your family.

Democrats as usual are supporting the enemies of the USA. Great.

MONEY FOR SYRIA?  Do not be confused or overlook the fact that those wanting to send money to Syria are only a committee of 12 members and it is from the Democratic minority in the US House led by Majority John Boehner R-OH who's goal is to slash government spending from the Democrat's inablility to arrive at a balanced budgt for which we have not had in three years and sustained only with Congressional CRAs?

17 trillion in debt and we get into ANOTHER war.  Brilliant.

Keep it up democrats and your butts will be gone in 2014.

Those Syrian Rebels have a serious Tyranny Government on their hands. I'm surprised the NRA in Syria can't or won't help them ? Even "brothers in arms Together".

i say give each side 500,000 machetes and let em kill each other  then sell the winner fords,not the cars from (gmc tho) that is government motors for you people in chigago.

How about some Humanitarian Assistance to Taxpayers that have to pay for useless garbage paid for with a credit card?  Why doesn't Europe pay?  Why doesn't Russia pay?  Why doesn't Brazil pay?  Why doesn't China pay?

Just give them the weapons that don't look "scary",  That will bring peace. LMAO

Oh, how hawkish of them?The Obama regime is a total failure, almost enemy, both foreign and domestic!Pull Out the Rye Bread and Mustard Gas, it's a homerun babyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy

Apparently the itching for another war is crossing the aisle onto the Democratic side now.

They dis arm Americans and give weapons to Arabs who hate us and will use them against us.  Good foreign policy Obama

Any arms given to Syria will eventually wind up in the hands of the muslim brotherhood and be used against us and Israel.

No.

why not! Its not like Americans care about the debt anyway! They reelected Obama!

Whats wrong with these fools in washington--do they not understand the word no-all we have managed to do in the mid east is give money and some of our troops lives--why dont engle, mccain and marco get there butts on a plane to the mid east and do there best at stopping all this mess--they already know it wont stop so why go--obama may be sending a letter to invite them here--everything is free--this is so stupid-we cant even get out of one place till washington is wanting to move somewhere else--how did all these idiots get in washington?

I agree with Mr. Deegam; There are NO Muslim groups in the Middle East that will remain a Friend of the U.S. even if we gave them the damn world!! Let them sort out their own problems &amp; keep our nose &amp; money out of it..We need to quit being the World Police Force.

Democrats want to support TERRORIST. This will surely come back to haunt us. We fought a bloody war against these same people in Iraq and these are the same people who would wipe the US off the map if they had the means. Another Obama blunder in the making.

We the People seem ready for such a conversation — just think of all those story views. (By contrast, the next most popular Forbesdotkom story garnered 87,384 views.) You, the media, need to make sure the administration doesn’t get away with stonewalling.That’s what we get now, if we get anything. Government spokesmen, when they’re not trying to make 1.6 billion bullets sound like a frugal, Costco-style bulk purchase, will tell you it’s all about target practice. Really? I hear that U.S. Army newbies soon to deploy to Afghanistan are training with blank cartridges. Why the priority for arming domestic forces, not military ones?Even the liberal-minded “debunking” site Snopesdotkom confirms that the Social Security Administration has procured 174,000 hollow-point bullets for 300 special agents. Meanwhile, the National Marine Fisheries Service, which is tasked with “protecting fish stocks from depletion,” has procured 46,000 hollow-point bullets. Spokesman Scott Smullen explained, straight-faced, I am guessing, that 63 fisheries service “enforcement agents” will be using the so-called cop-killer bullets for “target qualifications.”And that’s nothing. Last month, Paul Joseph Watson of Info warsdotkom reported that DHS purchased 21.6 million more rounds of ammunition, including 10 million hollow-point bullets. The latter, of course, are prohibited by the rules of war.Commentators who have done the math tell us the feds’ ammo dump includes enough bullets to fight the war in Iraq for 27 years, or enough bullets to shoot every American citizen five times over.Ridiculous? Conspiracy theory? Sorry to pop that bubble of well-being, but we have only blind faith to convince us that any of this is ridiculous, even that any of this is a conspiracy. The evidence, so far, is in the ammo. The whoppers and the stonewalling come from the government. You, the mainstream media, can restore balance with attention and exposure.You might start with Watson’s coverage last month for Infowarsdotkom of Law Enforcement Targets Inc. (LET), a Minnesota-based manufacturer that has received $2 million in unspecified contracts from DHS in the last three years. Recently, Watson writes, the company began selling cardboard cutout targets designed to “desensitize police” to “nontraditional threat targets,” as the online catalog called them. These targets included very pregnant women, children and other civilians in home, playground or other neighborhood settings. All hold guns. Public outrage over Watson’s online reports was such that LET apologized on Facebook for the company’s “No More Hesitation products” and removed them from its website.In its apology, LET insisted these heinous civilian targets weren’t the company’s idea. “This product line was originally requested and designed by the law enforcement community …”#$%$ you engel   you want to limit new yorks weapons but you want to give military weapons to civis in another country    go #$%$ yourself

um, didnt we do that once already and the rebels became a terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, which turned and attacked the United States... why not give the US this aid instead, WE the People need it more

why send aid to them when he was sending guns to terrorist over there

Engel, Mccain and the rest of you bloodthirsty necons have the NRA weapon you up and go over there yourself ask Bain capital to foot the bill.

Grave error  Another dumBO idea like Lybia.  OKY-Jelly LUVE it 4mo yahooooooooooooooooo

DEMOCRATS THE PARTY OF WAR AND TERRORISTS

Let's mind our own damn business for a change.If other countries want to kill each other who are we to intervene.

Tell Eliot we are broke!

Our politicians have drove us to the point of taking up arms and removing every politician in office and replace them with non lawyers and real working people. Of coarse the people are to fat and lazy to even work to make our jobs come back.

Yes, give them the firepower to get this interminable slaughter of innocents over! Whether the country becomes a fundamentalist dictatorship or a gleaming example of democracy; at least the killing will end!Great idea I'm sure the Republicans will happily pay for it

We need a comprehensive approach to stopping the Budget carnage here in the U.S. fisrt.

Race of vipers, you aided Savimbi in Angola but he was defeated, you armed Sadam hussein with chemical weapons against Iran and he was defeated. Are you going to win in syria against Russia, China and Iran?...

Those same rebels the idiot Democrat wants to arm and give aid too, a few weeks ago kidnapped westerners that were trying to help them! Why are stupid politicians trying to create another bin laden?

Why are politicians giving people's tax dollars to other countries, specially countries that hate us when we don't even have money for ourselves?! STOP RAISING TAXES, AND CUT AID TO OTHER COUNTRIES!

Sometimes I wonder if politicians hate USA when all they do is tax to give to other countries, and they even are trying to destroy our constitution! Vote them out people!

Lets cut medicare so we can fund the rebels in Syria, and let me see, how about closing our national parks to give more funding to Karzain in Afghanistan..and let me see...lets cut all unemployment benefits and send that money to Egypt. Great job to US Congress!!

Sure send our money to arm terrorists in Syria, where do we get these idiot politicians with their insane ideas.

Fast &amp; Furious part II

To give weapons and aid to a country and it's people who hate America in hope that they will someday like us is just plain  FUBAR!Sure,lets just BORROW some more money from China and send the cash right over to them.I suppose American Politicians should"reach out" To ALL Nations and see if anyone needs a few million,heck billion . According to Bernanky we can just apply some more"quantative easing", Which Is Fancy Words For"Lets Just Print Some More Money To Fix, I Mean PATCH The Problem.Meanwhile As Americans our government says we have to cut back,some politicians are actually in favor of reniging on the social security promise to americans.

Alawites' blood on your hands, Americans!

The wonderful 'Arab Spring' outcome in Egypt wasn't good enough, so now we have to go and do the same thing to Syria?

How about focusing on aiding the US of A for a change.  Any 'aid' we ever give any Islamic rebels do us no favors.

I am a proud American, born and raised with the bigger family has been in this country since its inception and even before. After reading the material above I feel disappointed in the goverment. I feel the States should just stay out of the conflict altogether, that includes our goverment. The goverment is supposed to work for the citizens of the United States not some foreigners that come here and ask or demand that our tax dollars be contributed to the Unholy cause of some other countries catastrophy.

The 'Rebels' are full of Jihadists.When Assad is gone they'll turn on the Free Syrian army. The jihadists are not fighting to make Syria a democracy.

Stupid politicians will never learn from history.  I can't think of a single incident where we armed foreigners to fight their foreign wars, and it did not come back to bite us in the #$%$!!!

instead of giving foreign aid how about taking care of our AMERICAN CITIZENS first.

who does the house represent the american people or a foreign country. what a house of Fools... its not our business or our fight...stay the hell out of it...

sure give them more money that we owe to Chinasure give them more money that we owe to China

Why are Zionist (J)ews such as Engel once more pushing America into more entanglements and wars for Israel?  It is clear that Israel is behind the organizing training of the Muslim terrorists attacking the Syrian people and the Syrian government.  Now we have Zionist (J)ews that are suppose to be representing America but instead represent the (J)ewish state.

HEY Representative Eliot Engel OUR COUNTRY  IS BROKE-we just cut funding to train OUR OWN troops but you want to give money to rebels--WHAT THE F#%$% IS WRONG WITH YOU

No!!! You would have to be an idiot! It's the screwed up middle east!

What is this idiot thinking?  The US has no stake it what is going on in Syria.  Let the Syrian people determine their own fate.  Russia/Iran is arming the gov. if we get in to in it is a war by proxy.  The only people who will prosper in the US supplies lethal arms is the arms dealers.  As we know the US is the number 1 supplier of weapons in the world.  How does this coexist with our claim of christian beliefs?

And the next thing you know, we'll be in Syria trying to sort out the crazies.

The same democratic (hipocritic) party that wants to arm Syrian rebels wants to disarm US citizens to prevent us from rebelling against their utter nonsense and socialist controls, higher taxation, refusal to protect our borders, and destroying the American way of life.

All U.S. Gun Owners, turn in all your guns and ammo, were donating them all to the Syrian Rebels

I am not here to take sides of any issues or express any opinions as I no longer have any opinion of anything since none of this means anything to Me. I am desperate and need help I have had no job for over 2 years, lost my home and my car. I got married in 2007 and planned on starting a family but since my streak of bad luck I cannot even support my wife let alone start a family. I feel life has cheated Me out of the things that many take for granted. I had to move in with my elderly father and cannot find any work. I have no friends, and I am at the end of a rope with nowhere to turn. Before you judge Me, this computer is not even mine. I don't have a phone either. I am now 44 years old with nothing to show for myself. I am stressed and lost my way to get on my feet. I would die for a job and cannot even afford to go to nearby Boise to find work. I cannot get Government assistance because I am a man able to work, and have no dependents. I have no unemployment or any other source of income. I sold almost everything I had of value. The only good things for Me are my health and no debt. I am asking for any help. Please.. Danny Kern  1095 Teal Circle Mountain Home Id 83647

Is anyone really surprized by this? Just wanna thank All the IDIOTS that put Obama/Democrats in office. Thanks Alot!!!!!Yep the Dems want the Syrians to have have high power weapons to protect themselves, but not US citizens.

lethal aid : )

Isn't this the same way we helped create Saddam Hussein?  Just a little aid here a little there.  Ugh, will we ever learn to keep our noses out of business that does not pertain to us.

We are in do much trouble because of these democrats. Yes yes I know it's GB fault. We can't afford to keep the WH tours but arming the rebels no problem. Amazing.

HELL NO stay out of it!

How about we sell them aid at a reduced cost. How about we quit printing money liberals.

Now we know what the Democrats want to do with the weapons they confiscate from the law abiding American citizens? Give them to and train terrorists how to ultimately use them against us! Shame on you American voters, for putting your petty needs before the good of our nation!

Better for no good congress to find a lethal solution for the economy and stop helping terrorists and destroying another sovereign nation.. Stop spending our tax money on filthy policy

As always, we are here for no other reason than to do Israel's bidding.  If Israel wants us to arm the Syrian rebels, we should be prepared to jump immediately.  God bless!

Again fueling the fire.The US must demand the UN step up and defend these people or the US must leave the UN and all its fee's can be used to aid these people who are in need.If our world leaders want to be known or claimed as Hero's by such people then they have to ACT like hero's and get the rest of the world to come along together, sharing the cost and lives it takes for democracy to prevail unilaterally across the globe. Otherwise if Congress wants to help these needy people then give up the illegals becoming citizens here and EVICT them from the country, not just the jails to reek havoc on America. Its time the citizens tell Congress what they have been telling us all these years, "YOU CAN NO LONGER HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.........ANYMORE!

defeat us imperialism

Charity begins at home....how long will it take us?

Hell #$%$ no! No weapons for them rebel aka - islamist extremist, islamist terrorist

These people on both sides are aminals.  Let them kill each other the more the better.  Let them fight their own war.   Americans have no right to even get involved.  The big corporations will lobby for this so they can sell billions in weapons.  Shameful

NO! Stop spending our money! Let the foreigners settle their own affairs. It always works out the best that way! By interferring we also mess everything up! Stop spending our tax money on foreigners....President Washington advised that too! Open the White House! Start paying our Military Veterans benefits again that you took away because "We have no money." Seems to be plenty of money in the past 2 months for Egypt and Syria, Over $2,000,000,000 billion dollars!!! in free aid!

U.S. House Democrat wants lethal aid for Syria rebels?We going to send them a double barrel shotgun?

Yahoo's top contributor stuff is BS. Typically you have crying Republicans on here calling Obama names and they get "medals" for that? You call that quality postings? Crying about losing 5 out of the last 6 elections shouldn't get you awarded by Yahoo!

Please impeach Engel.  He doesn't belong in Congress.  Warmonger.

Well obviously the best way to end the violence is to throw more weapons into the mix.  NOT!  Why should we give weapons to people who will most likely hate us even more than Assad did?  When will people learn that the enemy of my enemy is not necessarily my friend?  Look what happened in Egypt and the other Arab Spring countries.  Are people's memories really that short?The Liberals arm the Mexican drug cartels, disarm the tax paying American public, use our tax money to buy up all the ammunition throughout our country, fail to press charges against gangsters threatening voters during an election.......what is their end game??

How about this democratic party...Why not use THAT money to have the White House stay open and buy down the Obama debt??????

Hell NO!!

Why are we wasting money on the middle east?  ENERGY  Mr President wake up and put policy in place to make us energy independent of a useless segment of the world!

Maybe if Muslim man will convert in to a different religion they will become a human

Another intervention. When will they learn. What's in it for them/us?

So let me understand this we can be locked up in defiantly with out a trial or due process if the government thinks we are collaborates with a terrorist group under the NDAA.But our government uses our hard earned money to support several terrorists group to fight a government and in the process 70 thousand civilians have died and now they want to Kiev these terrorists lethal aid.  Just exactly who is making these decisions

We arm the islamic extremist rebels, russia and iran arm the islamic extremist regime, they kill each other off. Whats the down side here?

Hey engel reach in your deep pockets for these subhumans ! America first should be the cry of every politician. engel must be getting a kickback from the syrians.

"Democrat wants lethal aid" What else is new?How about using the money for White House tours?

Offering the Syrian rebles aid or arms would be the same as giving a mod a rope to hang you with.

The way I look at it is,  if the rebels are doing good so far, why don't they just pick up the weapons from the fallen soldiers of Assad.  That would make more sense, just supply the ammunition and don't get any further involved.  I don't want another war that we cant win...

Dear Mainstream Media,Back in 2008, candidate Barack Obama went off his teleprompter and added a couple of sentences to the text of a speech about expanding the Peace Corps and AmeriCorps. Over rolling applause, the soon-to-be president of the United States said: “We cannot continue to rely only on our military in order to achieve the national security objectives that we’ve set. We’ve got to have a civilian national security force that’s just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.”At the time, Joseph Farah of WNDdotcom wrote a column calling on you to help shine a light on what this shocking statement really meant. In a permanent state of vapors over Obama’s candidacy, you were of no use when it came to extracting anything but press releases from Team Obama.Nearly five years later, it hardly matters that candidate Obama’s promise to double the Peace Corps and the rest has come to naught. But the president’s unscripted determination to empower a civilian national security force is a different story. As far as you’re concerned, though, it’s also a nonstory.This complacency or complicity has to stop. During the last 10 months, the Department of Homeland Security has purchased 1.6 billion rounds of ammunition, including millions of hollow-point bullets. The department also has purchased 7,000 fully automatic assault rifles, and it has overseen the retrofitting of more than 2,000 light tanks, which, of course, were originally designed to resist the mines and ambushes of the battlefield. Why does DHS need such offensive and defensive firepower?Remember, DHS stands for Department of Homeland Security, and “homeland,” just to be extremely clear, means the USA. Obama must be asked against which domestic enemy he is arming nonmilitary forces. It sounds incredible, to be sure, but are we watching administration battle plans take shape against American citizens on the streets of Your Town, USA?That’s where you in the mainstream media come in. This story has been burning up the “alternative press” of our Internet age —   Drudge Report Info wars W N d for months, even years. As noted by Natural News, another “alternative” source, it’s only this week that the story is finally showing up in the mainstream media. Leapfrogging off a very thin Associated Press story of Feb. 15, Forbesditkom contributor Ralph Benko made quite a splash (664,581 views) this week with a more substantive piece acknowledging these same menacing stockpiles and calling for a “national conversation.”

if it has any thing to do with SPENDING more money for obama he will do it ! so he can meet his GOAL that the crooked banker thieves gave him to run this country into insolvency !! so they can take our bill of rights that has been a thorn   in there side for DECADES!!! marshal law!! take away the guns!! why does this nation need 492 thousand DHLS agents? why did DHLS buy 1.6 billion rds of hollow point ammo and 2 million targets of women and children!! why did obama say the debt was sustainable for the next 10 years !! do you see him doing any thing for this nation!!!! even the senators are starting to talk about what he is doing to this nation!! driving this country into default!!!! PURPOSELY!!!!!

They are all terrorist. just look at what they are doing killing captured soldiers. They are getting to be no better than Assad. The Demorcrats should take a good look at the other Arab nations that we supposely helped, none of them are trust worthy and they all hate Americans,

Why not the Jewish Eliot Engel migrate to Israel and fight the war with Syria ... stop dragging US into war ....pathetic parasites ....

just send Engel there. we have enough problems of our own, so let their country figure it out, it is not our business anyway. We have been there and done that, like iraq and afgan. US ARMY RET

lets spend more money that senior citizens have to pay for via medicare and social security

This is a recepie for disaster. We are trying to help one group of criminals to overthrow another group of criminals.This is a recepie for disaster. We are trying to help one group of criminals to overthrow another group of criminals.

The rebels in Syria are responsible for several huge slaughters of their own people and are carrying out a war of attrition and our broke government wants to add more debt on us, DEMOCRATS - the party of antiwar yet - leading the pack? No wonder Obama is pushing to disarm us, he wants no opposition to the tyranny being laid on us. NO MORE WARS!

I find it funny that a New York Representative is pushing to arm the citizens of another country, when New York just took arms out of thier own peoples' hands.  I guess it is more important for Syrian people to be able to defend themselves!

Dems want to arm al queda? i am shocked.  About as shocked as learning that obama lies.

Cost is cheap when compared to the muslim brotherhood air force supplied by brother obummer.

The same (J)ews who are working to destroy the constitutional right of American to "possess and bear arms" are simultaneously working to send more arms to Israel and their proxy Muslim terrorists attacking the Syrian people and their legitimate government.  Why?

Seem like the Dem's and Repub's need to come up with a plan to arm Americans with some good paying jobs first!

How much secret commission  Democrat will get from Israel.? Anyway rebels are fighting for Israel at the cost of American people.

How about you train and arms our citizens….with some work skills, knowledge, and a job. Jack pot’s in Washington want to spend money in other countries while we have to tighten our belts at home. Why don’t you put it to a vote and let the American people decide……my vote is NO! Keep my money in AMERICA where it belongs.

they should be crying for aid to the hundred of thousand little children in america that they just took healthy food out of theirs mouths and kicked out of preschoolthis guy is nothing but a paid puppet for the warmongers and war profiteersA war that Obama and democrats created!

NO NO NO NO NO STAY OUT OF IT

welcome to obamas land .formally known as america

listen u dumb Americans must realize the fact that humanitarian help could have fooled people in the 80's.  now a days everyone knows that's a load of s  h  i  t

Quit spending our money on other people , spend it on us it's our money not yours.  You want  to help them spend your money open your moth infested wallet ya #$%$

...dems and reps are sick bloodsuckers, greedy leftovers of their brain sees only $$$, then they'll cry for help when their friends the Terrorists blow US embassies, towers etc. US Government is out of control, like a mad rabies dog should be put to sleep, all of them.

just gotta grease the hands of some of their buddies

Yeah let the DEM's pay for it out of their healthy salary, not the taxpayers.  Maybe they can all leave DC and make themselves useful in Syria. Oh and maybe just maybe Obama might join them since he hasn't really done a real military service. Then he can say he is a real Commander and Cheif. I haven't figured that one out yet. That should be qaulifier for the office. Then they know what WAR is really about, when they decide to send our people to every conflict that arises. Oh I forgot his is a business oppertunity. Just maybe Humanitarian.MAYBE! Lets sell some weapons. Kching!

Let someone else help them with military stuff

i love this 1984 style double speak..lethal aid,,sounds like Band aid..and What are the guns and amo and support weapons and cash they give the "terrorists" one day "rebels" the nextFreedom fighters all till America Drones your #$%$S after setting you in motion..kinda likeBin Latin,,,,hell the next false flag Mossad commits will have your name on it.. re runs...raise OUR TAXES then give OUR money AWAY. We need to replace allof you.

NO!  Haven't we learned anything in the last decade about meddling in the affairs of the Middle East?

I see, lets arm another foreign countries "Rebel Factor" and forget about our troops here and what they do in keeping us free-Or have we been using these troops to keep President Obama's cabinet free to reign terror and destruction on us--This has got to stop NOW!

Dang it. Here we go again.

hey maybe they can give the the guns that were baned in New York.

They are nuts !!!!

Why doesn't Engle introduce a bill to allocate the money for "lethal aid" for American people instead?

are you bullshitting me!!! how can we give aid to someone else when we can't take care of americans. how can you feed someone else family when your own family dont have food? STOP THE BS!!! GET OFF OF YOUR #$%$ AND FIX THE USA FIRST!!!

How it is possible that democrats are offering money to Islamist fanatic that we owe to China ?Where is a logic to this?

Why not just send a Seal team to get assad. Then come homeWhy not just send a Seal team to get assad. Then come home

Exactly right support nobody that can came back against us a terrorist is a terrorist enemy of the the people nothing else  fry them all including north korea and iran

Representative Eliot Engel  must not have heard of the sequester.  Now he wants to spend more money on other countries.   Not that it is a bad idea, but lets take care of America first.

Why don't we just stay the *$&amp;^# out of the middle east. They all hate us and whoever wins in Syria will still be some extremist muslim culture. Use the money for our own people and our own military. Let Mohammed and Abdul kill each other.

If your terrorists and mercenaries win ,,they can now give you the Libya treatment by killing your Ambassador with your  weapons ,,,,,

no white house tours for children, but weapons and money for rebels who hate us after they take over...."AMERICAN SPRING"

Kerry faces pressure from syrian rebels?a bunch of #$%$ can put pressure on the sec.of state?which side wins is of no concern of ours;period.they all end up biting the hand that feeds them.

NO MORE AID TO MUSLUMS ANYWHERE YOU LIBTARDS.

it seems to me that historically everytime the US gives weapons to some faction in the mideast, those same weapons end up being used against us later...

Arming the Syrian rebels at this stage is an exercise in futility as there are not enough fighters to pose a serious threat to Assad's superior army as most of Syrian rebels were decimated by Assad and most Syrians have given up the hope of winning the war opting instead to becoming refugees in nearby sanctuaries. Instead of preparing for the end of Assad's regime, the West should prepare instead for the end of Sunni regimes and Western rule in the Middle East  as Assad's alliance with China, Russia, and Iran will precipitate the victory of the Shiites in the region and the expulsion of the western powers.How funny the radical democrats who pretend they are the nice guys and for the preservation of human rights are the more barbaric gang of killers.

In '89 when the USA went to get Noriega in Panama I was in the Army.  We found several weapon caches the he had with thousands of weapons still in the USA military  boxes.  They also had cases and cases of demolitions that we couldn't get to train with still in the U.S. Army cases.  Now the US government wants to take our weapons but supply a nation that would kill all of us if they have a chance....   STOP giving weapons to our enemies!!!!!!!!!

The hypocrisy of the U.S is suffocating  ... when these rebels are done killing U.S will call them terrorist and a threat to israel....israel are the ultimate beneficiary out of this whooole chaos folks....dont be fooled  ZIONISM IS CANCER

No foreign aid to any nation until our children our fed, our social security is fixed and our schools are number one again. Period.

america is THE center of rabid islamoterrorism.hillary=obioma=taliban

So we arm the rebels which gets paid for by increasing the debt of the taxpayers who are told by those we the people elect to represent us that debt has to be decreased by taking away from the citizens in our own country. We the people living in the United States never had it so good, right?

Sure, let's just pull another 500 million dollars out of our #$%$.... oh wait, we'll just print the money and say "we'll deal with it later"

When I'm traveling around the country, I use my real Muslim name. I make my hotel reservations under that name. I come to the desk and always see that 'here-comes-a-black-man' look. It's kind of a reserved, coldly tolerant cordiality. But when I say my Muslim name, their whole attitude changes: they snap to respect.

Spending your own money. Have you not learned the Iraq war lesson? Stupid. You keep sending arms to rebel side and claim Assas kills his own people.

Think twice. These arms will flow in the hands of AL Queda and will be used to kill Americans and other non Muslims. There are 15% Christians in Syria. Look at what happened in Egypt after the Arab Spring ? The Brotherhood has taken over and minorities and women have no rights. Be careful arming the Muslim Brotherhood.Let them fight it among themselves. Turkey, Saudi Arabia and other gulf countries have plenty of Arms and money. Let them do it, not US tax payers.Sure go ahead and indulge to your hearts content. Just also remember to budget twice the value and quantity for Israel, towards which these lethal weapons turn eventually. Good business for the defense contractors and arms manufactures, the only growth industry going.

Whit how much the jews looby (Bribe) this democrat for be their speaker ? is not more important our local economy and our citizens ?

cut the veterans college education, take away the American rights, steal our guns, then give um to a foreign country.  If your not American we will give it to you.  Damn.

john maCcain in brainless, since he lost half of his leg in Vietnam seem he lost part of his brain too and lost the remaining brain when he lost the presidential seat. A good-for-nothing #$%$ better be named "Muder Hero".

Thats nice, I never thought I will see the day when the U.S will arm Al Qaida. We should have left Iraq to Al Qaida, that would have saved a lot of American soldiers lives. Only if we knew that one day one of our own congressmans would request weapons for Al Qaida.

Comment Board says,,Article O,,,Americans 348

Does anyone remember that "WE", The Americans supported and armed the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan War? Look at what happened!!! Don't Arm Anyone! If anything, cut taxes and spending the same amount you wish to give Syria.

How about Aid for Schools, Senior Citizens, wanna be working Homeless? Fork all the aid We give to other Cunnntries,,,Time to Help US. NoBummer totally suckkkkks.

"Dear Mr. Engel I hope You have enough money in your private account so you can found it yourself.The rest of us, we are just plain broke. Thank you."

How about this..from now on, any spending Obama wants to do goes on his and Michelles credit card...Let him, his wife and their children pay off his debt...We have almost 17 trillion to worry about....I realy don't care who wins over there. The winner will still be muslim and that is not a good thing. The only good coming from this war is, with muslims killing muslims, they don't have time to kill anyone else.

The only weapons I would give them are the ones with an expiration date where the weapons will self-destruct after a certain time period. Unless the opposition can ensure without a shadow of a doubt that these weapons will not fall into the hands of Al Queda

We should follow the EU's policy of no lethal aid while elements of al queda lurck in the shadows. Allowing arms to fall into the wrong hands assisted the Benghazi debacle Obama wont come clean on.

Why don't they go over and lend Syria a hand at their fighting, It takes evil to destroy evil

Support President Assad

Support President Assad

the limited lethal AID weapons sent by U.S. will definitely be used against Israel as well.  the militants are extremist Wahabis.. they have the tendency to bite the hand which feeds them. they have no loyalty to anyone particularly,  they see everyone has deserving for death, and destruction, they are full of hate for non wahabi Sunni people.  (they don't even accept other kinds of non wahabi Sunnis)  they even kill Sufi Sunnis.. Since they don't like anyone, and they are very near the border of Israel, they will use it against Israel the non lethal weapons against Israel.bottom line... they are not worth supporting,  this whole IMPOSED WAR against Syria is a BIG MISTAKE for the U.S. and a waist of innocent people's tax money being pumped there.   U.S. and Israel are thinking..  we are making Muslims fight each other, that will save Israel.  but Israel must know that the Sunni wahabi extremist which is being supported is not lesser evil for them, its greater evil for them.  they are wild untamed dogs unleashed .. for Israel this civil war between Muslims is only like a temporary relief for their headache,  but this is not a permanent cure.the American Govt. must remember that the Syrians are under Shia and moderate Sunni versions of Islam.  the Shias do not compromise with injustice, they prefer death to humiliation and defeat.  we must learn a lesson from the past,  its Shias of Lebanon who kicked Israel out of Lebanon and defeated Israel officially.  this whole backing of Sunni Wahabi extremists is a failure for U.S. govt.   the unleashed wahabi extremist dogs will die in Syria.  their weapons are being seized by the Syrian army.  the American people's tax money should be used in American, for American citizens, .. the economy in America is not good.. this is WRONG WAYS OF WASTING MONEY!!! our money should not be used for death and destruction of innocent people of Syria,  it should be used in America, for America to create jobs and a healthy economy.

The reason Syria has escalated is because of the CIA gunrunning op from Benghazi to Syria this summer that ended with 9/11.   So this moron (a euphemism for Congressman), Idiot Engel want's to ramp it up again?   Fine, send him.  Put Engel on the front line with a gun in his hands.  I think he will have richly deserved his fate.

How many millions are you spending on egypt (lower case on purpose) and closing our house, the White House, to our citizens!

#$%$ Zionist Congressman Eliot Engel, wants to give away our taxpayers money to Syrian Al-Quada to overthrow the Syrian government so that Israel can be pleased!Americans, it's about time we wake the #$%$ up!I heard that our prez turned his Nobel Peace prize into a throwing star.

Its funny that us/israel is giving weapons to terrorist to kill innocent but taking them back from their own people.. Stand up america or you will be dooomed..

Hum...? wonder what's engels angle is ?

Perhaps they haven't heard of the recent extremists? Or maybe just really that we don't have the money...

Its ok, POTUS has a Nobel Peace Prize, thats like a get out of jail free card for arming warring factions, and Mexican drug cartels.

They just crawl out of one hole and back into another. Borrowing what for? This are the greatest times for the takers form America and around the world.

Syrians can have US guns but US citizens CANNOT have US guns ... hmmmmmmmmmm.  Washington is full of idiots.

Low IQed Americans again, trying to create more mayhem in the world!!

They seem to being fine without our help.

Bismillah The weapons --lethal aid proposed to reach rebels will never reach there.  Thus far no regimes weapons in the near east have reached the Syrian rebel forces although this claim of arming Syrian rebels is widely reputed by them and the US.  Does this democrat propose military logistics too.  When all logistics are tested and are either in the hands of the Syrian-Russian Regimes or grudgingly the battleground of the Mujahideen.  When the US says openly she will support the Mujahideen then will Syrians freely arm themselves against tyranny. And America have security without loss of freedom. But how will that be when tyranny abroad and tyranny at home are one in the same the denial of men to arm themselves with arms.Syrian Mujahideen successfully exterminate Russian puppets with a pinch of salt and a dash of lemonPublication time: 15 March 2013, 21:47Syrian Mujahideen and Free Syrian Army (FSA) have marked its second year of combating the regime. During the escalation of the conflict, the Russian-backed Alawites committed war crimes by executing artillery attacks, using cluster bombs, tanks and other heavy arms against Muslim civilian population, reports Al-Arabiya.The opposition forces have found themselves at a disadvantage in terms of weaponry available.It has been reported that artillery and weapons provided by supporters outside the country have not been able to reach opposition fighters throughout Syria. This has led some members of the FSA to develop their own weaponry in an attempt to level the playing field."We were unfortunate to not be armed like other fighters were in cities like Homs and Hama," Said Abu Hasan, a Free Syrian Army lieutenant in the province of Aleppo. "My group and I took on the fight as a win-win case, so we had to play a survival of the fittest game and defend ourselves from the attacks of these animals."Abu Hasan's team is comprised of 57 members; eight of them are capable of designing and manufacturing unique weapons, according to the lieutenant."Not all of our weapons are accurate and we do have few misses every now and then, but that is part of fighting in a battle. However, these homemade weapons provided us with the power we need to kill a few in every attack we launch."Abu Hasan's unit produces an average of 18-30 homemade rockets daily, and has built a rocket launcher by using "around the house goods" like the salt in the kitchen or acid extracted from freely available lemons.This particular team is mandated with the protection of Old Aleppo and only takes part in ground combat procedures. However Abu Hasan said he witnessed far more technically advanced inventions at different FSA bases within the city, where warplanes have been shot down with homemade artillery."The regime underestimates the mental capability of the Syrian people... although many of us are not educated; we are managing to invent weapons from scratch to destroy [the regime's] ginormous machines."The Salaam to Mullah Omar.  The Salaam to the sunni mahdi.  The Salaam to Khurassan Eagle.The comments tell the real story..media not so much

No weapons to these people ! Let china help them. We have helped those who hate us and turn on us too often ! No more !

Wonder why everybody's so mean in this chat room..to that poor political  guy..who wants their guns,,guns kill.. people in this chat must not have much respect for their Masters..Now Let's have that War and you starving loosers get to work on my cotton patch,,ill have no moreon it,,now give the nice man your money and your #$%$ gun..so he can give it to those Freedom fighters they pay more than our solders to Die,,like the bush man said,,time for a N.W,O. and they intend to have it no matter how you sissy Americans Squeal,,kiss the ring

Interesting that it is Eliot Engel a NY gew leading this betrayal of sending more taxpayer paid weapons, since the "rebels" are the same Sunni Al-CIAda terrorists who they said did 9/11, murdering &amp; injuring thousands of Engel's constituents in NYC area, and that Israel never attacks those same Sunni Al-CIAda terrorists, even when they are operating right along the israeli border in the Golan heights. Something very fishy about all of this

Just say no

video of Syrian children getting blown off their bicycles by a rebel tank is followed up by a video of honey boo boo outtakes.  watch it on your iSuicide if you want to.

Why arm just some ? Why not all ?

So that another country can be taken over by Muslims.

The answer is absolutely NO! Eliot Engel is taking orders from AIPAC! We have budget problems in the United States. There are no winners is Syria. The only choice is Radicalized Sunni muslims or radicalized Shia muslims. None of them are worth are tax dollars!

Send me. OK, I shot two people by mistake, own 34 guns, a bow and a slingshot. I have been told by half the nation that I an nuts. I love guns, I like the way they scare people to death, I like the way the oil gets into my skin when I stroke them. I like shooting things that move more than things that stand still. I have sold about 50 weapons privately (I don't care who buys them). Does that mean that I should be denied the right to own or carry? they won't care over there. I would be able to run again if I serve.What will the Nobel Peace Prize Selection Committee Think?

Really? Trillions spent in Iraq and Afghanistan and they still don't get it. They don't want our policies just our money.

Once again the dual party strikes. The draft boomers in the beltway know we are not getting involved in the repub foriegn wars. The draftboomers in the beltway know we are not raising democrat taxes (revenue) again. What do ring forth the taxes they do? trade positions. Get the repubs to bring forth the new taxes, and get the dems to bring forth the next foriegn war. dual party games. vote out the draft boomers, it is up to us 30-50 year olds to save our constitutional republic.

Dear President Barack Obama. I am belonged to America, but I feel sorry for the Children and Parents in Syria, I don't have a single drop of blood from syrian people but I want you to finish their suffering by ending the terrorists regime of assad. ...assad kept all saddam's biological weapons ..pls bring assad to justice ,that's what the ROLE of America to bring PEACE to the chaotic countries...

hmm thats surprising the guy who helps oversee the arming of terrorists in africa for staged mineral grabs wants to arm the terrorists in syria to get a stronger grasp on the middle east... the worst regime in world =america

send them Fienstien instead...

just give them air support we did it before and it worked out. Let the rebls fight on the ground just give them air support

WOW a Democrat talking "tough". TOO LATE buddy, YOUR party wants our military gutted. NO WAR UNTIL there is an INCREASE in Defense Budget at REAGAN levels. Tell your boss BATHOUSE Barry to listen up.

arm dealers are happy , another blood merchant customer

Yes Pat-- Accupy wall street also needs lethel aid from Mexico -----WOW, the dems want to TAKE OUR weapons, and they want to give rebels weapons.   They wouldn't be giving them the feared and hated "Assault Rifles" will they?   You bet your ars they will...

Democrats are Muslim Terrorists Lovers!!

Have they not learned from past mistakes look at both Iran and Iraq wow wow

hey Eliot, listen Carefully #$%$, we are broke, any pol1tician that borrows -money to ue in Syria will be hunting work, you stupid scrub

STOP training and giving those people any more help, one day, they are going to turn against the US.

The EU Leaders  of the 1950-90 used to be a moderate and strong influence in Western Policies then but these presents Leaders have turned themselves  a willing Tools and Stooges in the hand of presents US leaders especially France and Britain,,,in the name of  Alliance, ,,Like the Arab Puppets  monarchies,,

It's a shame it took so long, so many people dying, at least we finally helping them out, looking forward to some progress.

possibly back by gun lobbyist please sell my  gun there a war some where

We led the slaughter of the Libyan armed forces....why not the Syrians??

Time to help the Syrian people to get rid of this tyrant mafia regimeYou need to stick together or the white men will eat you alive.

STOP the sequester, save Ameican Jobs!!  Cut government waste, fraud, enforce immigration laws, reduce and cap hand-outs, CUT foreign aid.

Man, the gutless repugs on this board are a hoot. First, they let 9/11 happen on their watch. Second, they push bush and cheney's lies for wars. Third, they cannot win their wars and have to let the dems win them. Now, these same repugs want to advise the Prez on this? Wow. LMFAOAY repugs!

DD this is for you  in case you havent aready figured it out every one hates americans

The fact is that america wants every muslim country to become another Iraq, afghanistan, lybia etc. so they are providing lethal weapons to sunni terrorists now. this thing will definitely happen if any muslim country allows saudi arabia funded madrasas to be opened in their country. these madrasas only produce brainwashed terrorists.

how come americans do not want to know where the 3.5 trillion dollars went  from the defence department under the Bush administration.there was never  an answer when Donald  Rumsfelt was asked the question. Just after though a plane conveniantly crashed into the offices at the pentigon were the files containing the answers to these questions were kept.

militant taxpayer eater

good idea by the americans they  can sell them arms and suport than after they  can like the taliban they can declare them terriorist . bomb their country killing more innocent women and children . all in all another good day in american democracy

Why would the U.S. want to arm the Syrian rebels, through American funding? Wouldn't they overthrow the dictator who keeps the people under control? And, if the Syrian rebels were to overthown their government, wouldn't they likely elect the Muslim brotherhood, as Egypt has, to run their government? How would that be more beneficial for the U.S.?

Don't we ever learn?Support the rebels and we will have another muslem country that will throw more bombs at us.
