" too many questions about the constitutionality of Colorado law to advise him how to plead." The Gov. is about to add to that list with his gun bills,

A little birdy told her.... don't give in..........remember WIKI

The problem with this is, Reporters have used "unidentified sources" in their stories, simply because they don't want to admit to using "illegal" means to get the information. Such as the Cell Phone Tapping tactics used before.

You wont and shouldnt get those sources.  THe press has repeatedly won these arguments over the years.

Seems legit.

Something fishy about these shootings. The press tries to reports on it and is gagged, not prosecuted.  Someone knows much more about this case and does not want the public to know.

Cant we just hang um high already ?
