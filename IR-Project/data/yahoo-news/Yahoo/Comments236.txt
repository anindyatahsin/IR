Can we hope for a similar solution in Cyprus ?

They (Kurds and their allies) are not that stupid. Turkey has become a major force economic powerhouse in the region and growing despite a trillion dollar loss due to that stupid war. They finally realized including their western supporters that the best thing to do was to join the fiesta than boycotting it.  The food served is excellent. Why not taste it?The choice is simple. Why did Texas join the Union despite its huge Mexican-Spanish population?  Same thing holds true here. Kurds are better off with union as long as they hold a regional power. I am saying that as a Turkish myself.

I thought Iraq was going to be a democracy with flowers for everyone after the great USA came in and spreaded our magic?

How can they tell who is who amongst all these middle eastern groups, by colors??

Amazing how Obama looks just like the Devil in the Bible!

Creation of a new Kurdish nation Turks are not happy but they have no choice this is like the Afgan war for the Russians. They have been fighting for four decade and they could not win it. Only way is to give them what they want which is land and their freedom. What ever you plant that is what you harvest. Turks are gona fall in for the pit they have dug. Go Kurds much deserved how can you nat be a nation if you are thirty to fourty million in that region

Ocalan is a mountain ape

They are all muslims. who cares

From his cage he is delivering freedom and democracy. What a spectacle.
