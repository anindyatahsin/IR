NY fracking foes: will become lobby if required

ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) â€” Artists Against Fracking say the group and supporter-celebrities, including Yoko Ono and Sean Lennon, haven't been told to register as lobbyists in their campaign to stop gas drilling in New York, but will if required to continue their cause.
A good-government advocate and two lobbying experts said Monday the state should review whether Artists Against Fracking and the celebrities should be registered as lobbyists. That would require disclosure of how much money they've raised and how it's been spent. The measure a way for the public to know who is influencing policy.
A spokesman for the group said it will register if required to.
The group and dozens of celebrities have opposed the hydraulic fracturing method of gas drilling that New York is considering for an economically depressed area upstate.
