It's like he has no emotion what so ever. Seems like he don't want to even be there.

Is the Treasury Secretary looking for borrowing more trillions of China money on Americantaxpayers backs,while the politicians in Washington are threatening a war with China overits sea border-line dispute with the Philippines?

Wonder what the secretary would have said "Your President has been determined to be a bad credit risk." "All your notes are due and payable immediately." "Have a nice day!"

China is one of the most important foreign countries that are buying the US debt.

BUT~BUt~But~but.......He was here to see Dennis Rodman........

fleeced - again?

Lew must have the same hair stylist as Xi, both have the same hairline. Given that most westerners are bald by the time the reach 30, Lew must have a lot of ginseng and madam butterfly to hairdo.

Xi facial expression is priceless, "uh geez, asking for more money again..."

of course Xi wants to meet his newest "YES" man!! .....They own the treasury now anyways , don't they!?

That chinese man know that american man is a zionist jewish devil and hate his guts.. Thank god for china.Most likely asking for more money for more wars.

Look at Xi's face. He probably is wondering when he can go take a swim and disappear for a few weeks.
