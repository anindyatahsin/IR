I wish she could just go away somewhere and stay out of news and leave people alone.

I hope she gets what she deserves: NOTHING! The only story she should tell is what really happened when she murdered her baby and threw her away like a bag of garbage! I can't wait till her 15 minutes are over and she either OD's or blows her brains out! That I'd pay to see!

You are stupid and Casey was not falsely accused, she killed her daughter and got away with it, so be it it's done. But she should not get to make any money off this story.

I hope everything works out for Casey. she has been so strong, being falsely accused. Most of the jealousy comes from fat child birthing woman, whom let there bodies go. her baby is with Jesus. And you fat oinkers what to tear her up. Go turn on your soaps, eat a box of bon bons, and dream of the days you were moist and a man wanted you.

she doesnt remember any part of her life she was out partying and blacking out.yea i would buy that book.

I wish people would just let this go so it would fall out of the news. LOL  This kind of action is never going to work, or it would be done every single time a celebrity files for bankruptcy.  You can't force the person filing to participate in a dog-and-pony show of your choosing.  If she didn't participate and give her side of the story and lengthy interviews, it would be worthless and no one would pay anything.  This is all just grandstanding by the lawyers, who know it isn't going anywhere, but are longing for free and easy publicity.

Casey Anthony is Goddess.
