such bull. insurance companies want more money.

Catering to the illegals and unwilling - both proprietors of the welfare and food stamps offices.

WV already taxes your vehicle every year......doing this just makes driving more expensive and lines someone's pockets.

Just give really long prison sentences to people who purposely drive without insurrance.

Simply put, THEY want your money. And state congress will vote to give it to them. Nice,,, huh....

If you think healthcare is expensive now just wait until it's free.

"About 11 percent of the drivers in West Virginia are uninsured"  Why are there so many drivers in WV operating a motor vehichle without insurance? Do we not have laws against this?

"Driving is a privilege," Blass said. "If you're going to get out there and drive, you have to have coverage to protect people that you could cause damage to." I agree 100%.  If some poor #$%$ drunk hits and injures me, I want HIM to pay the bills; not me.

I moved to WV from North Carolina last year. My premiums went up almost 30% with the SAME insurance company.  They told me the minimums were higher in WV.  So they're going up even higher?  Nice.
