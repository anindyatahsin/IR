Meijer expands its Made in Michigan program




GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Meijer is expanding a program that's designed to support small businesses.
                  
Company Co-Chairman Doug Meijer announced Tuesday that the Made in Michigan initiative will feature 55 new locally made grocery products in all its stores statewide.
                  
Meijer launched Made in Michigan early last year with the Michigan State University Product Center for Food-Ag-Bio.
                  
The project's goal is to help strengthen Michigan's economy by supporting small businesses in the state.
                  
The initial offering featured 49 grocery items, including marinara sauce, blueberry butter and gluten-free baking mixes.
                  
The Grand Rapids-based company says this year's lineup of Michigan-made grocery products will be more visible in all of the 102 Meijer stores in the state.
