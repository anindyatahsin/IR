How did he get his hands on a fully automatic rifle? Because that is what an  assault weopon it.

so, he was in a dorm with 3 roommates making "bombs" and had these guns and nobody knew? come on. and i also find it hard to believe that he had an assault rifle. or is this just another case of the idiot newsmedia re-defining what an assault rifle is? when i lived in the dorms a student was kicked out of school for having "explosives". the explosives were firecrackers. firecrackers. he had not used them in the dorm but were found during some "safety inspection" because some #$%$ told campus police that he had seen them in the poor guy's room. two other guys were booted for making coke and baking soda "bombs" that they were playing around with in front of a frat. but it was sensationalized into a big, scary deal like they were planning to blow up a building-with baking soda and coke?

Another nra member flunks his basic training.

where is wayne lapierre???

so...on campus security...mental health programs...better screening...intensified background checks...these things so demanded by the liberal educators, when will they begin ?????

Of course he has gun(sss), all these so-called sane people have guns.  This one luckily decided to kill himself without killing 10 or more with him.

Finally! A gunman who did it the right way! He killed himself and took no one with him.The world is a better place with one less whacko in it.

That's gotta deplete your need for morning coffee. Glad no one else washurt.  Kuddos to the evac team!

If only his roommates had assault rifles all of this could have been prevented.

a drama queen must of wrote this storyI wish Mark Kelly would do the same thing with his gun.

Here we go again, another young man with delusions of violence.  We know these guys are not members of gangs!  We are aware they are beyond basic educational standards.  So? What are we going to say for the society we've created?
