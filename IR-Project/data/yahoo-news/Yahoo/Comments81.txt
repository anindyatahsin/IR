I see the Lira on the horizon.

Italy get rid of Monti as soon as you can.  Monti is nothing more than an agent of Goldman Sachs and the IMF.  His main objective has been to bleed you dry and strap you with more Money Changer Dept.

Italy needs to get rid of its senate (just like every other nation that has one of those useless impolitical bodies . .  .).

Will their ever be white smoke?

Back to the ballot box? No problem..keep wasting taxpayer money.

What a mess! Europe is in a complete mess! Capitalism sucks! Capitalism means endless austerity for the working people. Build revolutionary workers parties! Follow the road of Lenin &amp; Trotsky.

Monti is a puppet of the goldman sachs investment banker syndicate....he wants to raise italians taxes to pay off bad bank loans.

With a president whose last name is Napolitano, and a prime minister whose last name is Monti, why should anyone be surprised that Italy is in turmoil? Bunch of greaseballs.

if the most democratic method fail to select a party as ruling party, it only meant one thing.no one deserved to be the ruling party.it is time to select the pope as ruling party as least he was elected by majority of cardinal.

italy president should honour their promise made to india supreme courtwould the eu act impartial and fair in this dispute?
