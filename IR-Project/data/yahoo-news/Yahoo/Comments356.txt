If u don't understand a stock or a sector for that matter maybe u shouldn't be putting your money there.Macau is the cash cow for lvs. Any reports from Macau have even more effect than financials. These are future trends driven.

This doesn't tell me anything.  Tell us why the casino stocks went up today, that would be news!!

A problem in Macao is how to get the Chinese Government out of the Gambling Business and let the Gaming professionals run the Casinos. The Chinese stand to gain big  tax revenues and it is a major entertainment spot for Chinese vacationers in Cotai. The casinos are packed and busy, and the transportation is getting better inside China. Let it ride.

sheldon  is a smart guy  who is spending a fortune to change  the present tenant in the white house.. he also thinks the middle east  needs a  better understanding of the environment  the the USA  must contend with regarding  THE MIDDLE EAST  geography created by Winston Churchill almost one hundred years ago.

LVS big earning, but it stock keep coming down,some kind of wall street scamm going on.

How can LVS be sold off after fabulous earnings?  This is the kind of thing that keeps investors OUT of the market.  If feels like a conspiracy!
