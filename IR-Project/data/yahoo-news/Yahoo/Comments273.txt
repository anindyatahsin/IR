Evey day they print more money, whatever you have in your retirement or savings is worth less and less. Soon it will be worthless.

When you play with fire, sooner or later, sombody's gonna get burned.

The Fed has no choice.  Obama's economy is anemic.  The slowest economic recover ever, and seriously endangered by the rising specter of Obamacare.  There will be no strong recovery until after Obama is out of office and his socialist policies reigned in!

All that means is that this country is being pushed farther and farther into the ditch in order to hid the damage that Obama is doing.

Go out and buy everything you can new right now! New cars, land, new home all that because as long as the fed is buying these phoney loans at 85 billion a month, it's all going to fall down like the stack of cards they are and at least you will have something.

Can dish it out but can't take it.

Record lows could be down to 30 percent interest on the loans of money they print with nothing to back it up.

Cyprus,,,U.S.A . in five years or less. Thanks Obama,, and congress. worthless #$%$.

Good plan FED!, All of your plans have been "spot on" so far, why would we think that will change?
