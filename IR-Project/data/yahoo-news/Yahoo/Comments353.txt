It sure is easy to feel sorry for those insurance companies, financial companies, and pharmaceutical companies.  The executives barely get paid enough to feed their families.

The reason why insurance is mandatory in some cases is because a lot of you idiots don't have enough assets to pay for the damage done!  For some reason no one ever turns down the check when the insurance company writes it. Oh I know because Obama paid the premiums.

Insurance is really a luxury , laws that made insurance mandatory is what the lobbyist got for buying out our congress.  It is over priced and they have a million reasons not to pay you with only one reason why they should. If Insurance was to pay you full value it is only because you had to get a lawyer and you still lose because the lawyer needs to get his share. If insurance was so good we would not need the government stepping in to help hurricane victims.  What insurance does is blame water on damages  and it doesn't matter if your house blew away before the water came.  Insurance needs to be abolished.

Why a mutual vs a stock company? Do you know the difference? If so explain. Thanks.

Legal mafia. "Pay us this money, and in case, uh, you know, you have an accident, we can, ah, take care of things..."

Insurance: one of humanity's greatest, most prevalent scams. One of the only things people can purchase in life which provides utterly nothing.

Go with a Mutual insurance company.  Not a stock company.
