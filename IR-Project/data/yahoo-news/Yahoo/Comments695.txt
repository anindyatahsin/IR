I thought my grandma was tough! Damn..

She is no Casey Anthony. What do you think?

Once again, absent parents.

He's on the phone to a 911 operator and she's still shooting? In self-defense? I don't think I'd want to be on the jury for this one.

My grandma hit me with her cane I am lucky she did not use her revoler but I was only 7.

Since when does one murder become a massacre?

I keep warning my Grandkids not to (P)(I)(S)(S) off Grandma.

Mine would just beat us with a broom-stick after we went to sleep.

Had a camera been there we probably would have heard, "I'm tired of your hooliganism and thuggery.  The world is better off without you!"  And she would not be wrong.  I'm more interested in hearing the reaction of the POS parents who would unload an unruly teenager with drug problems on a 70 year old woman.  The parents should be the ones going to prison.

Sounds like she just got sick of his bull****......

There's the out the judge just told the jurors what to do.Oakland County Judge Denise Langford Morris told jurors that acquittal based on self-defense could be appropriate if Layne "honestly and reasonably believed" that her life was in danger — even if she was wrong.Where the hell were his parents while he was growing up?

why were the  boy's parents a thousand miles away?

Heads up, all you doper little pukes out there.   People are getting tired of the #$%$.

When fear is involved there is no such thing as a reasonable person.As soon as the adrenaline starts pumping reasonable goes out the window and self preservation instincts takes over and you pull the trigger until the threat is no longer a threat.Not evil just human nature.

Shame on the boy's parents for placing their troubled teen with the 70+ grandmother. I'd be interested to know how many times she called them telling of the problems she was having with the boy. She most certainly should be found guilty, but I don't think 1st degree is right. What a tragedy. Then again, I could have a jaded view on this. Raising four grands, two of them teens, I feel her frustration.

The kid should have been with his parents.  Obviously she was having problems with this kid...so I have to ask again where were the parents.  All too many times grand parents take on way too much to help there own kids out and look what happens.  Family generations are getting all screwed up or should that be are.

They aren't telling the whole story as usual. This kid was nothing but trouble and his parents had kicked him out of their house. Grandma had taken him in but he was still such a terrible person even she killed her own grandson. The DA who is making this heart rendering speech would have been the same one who would have been badmouthing him for parole violation and trying to get him sent to prison if he hadn't of been killed. It was just a matter of time before someone killed him or he killed others.

On The Other Hand:What IF Grandmother had not shot him --- and what  if she was the one that  had picked up the phone and called 911 for help--How much damage could that Grandson --age 17,   have inflicted on his 74 year old female Grandmother in the several  minutes before the police arrived in her home to assist her -   when  the 17 year old grandson is staying   in the house with her -  wanted Money and wanted to Control  the situation and Grandma  and  wanted his Grandmother to give him exactly what he wanted from her.   How far would he have gone, physically,  against his grandmother before the police arrived on the scene---If  she had been the one calling  on the phone to 911 and it took several minutes for  help from 911  to arrive on the scene to Respond to a call to  from his  Grandmother?????Just wondering??

When he was bleeding to death on the floor, she became the criminal and he became the victim. You can shoot your attacker, but you can't come back 10 mintes later to finish the job.

This is going to be a tough one to call. The defense has a point: What did she have to gain by killing him. She could have just called the cops and had him thrown out of the house. But there is zero evidence indicating that he was threatening her - but then, that could have been verbal or left out of the article.Grandma's and Guns,... not a good combo!

If this kid was on K2 (or whatever it's called) and totally out of control and she feared for her life, I could understand her pumping him full of lead.  What I don't understand is why she shot him so many times - even while he was on the phone.  I guess in her mind she said "Grandma ain't going out like that."

10 Times, she must of really enjoyed it....  If I shot someone that many times I would really really disliked them and let them enjoy the pain and to look in my eyes as they fade away.

Aren't Grannies supposed to make ya soup and cookies?

Usually when your struck on the face, throat or anywhere on your body you will have a red mark, unless it was such a light tap. Grandma could have stopped shooting at any time but she kept shooting, 10 times, overkill if you ask me. I would vote grandma guilty based on the story written here.

she had a mad-on

...Granny Clampett must fry...shot him 10 times??? Stalked him and finished him off while he was on the phone with 911??? Not sure you can "massacre" only one person, but this is a particularly nasty, brutal, an vicious murder...if it were the teen who had killed the grandma, all of these people saying "not guity" would be enraged...

I wonder what other drugs were in her grandsons system? Some drugs that are out there are so powerful that the only way to get someone to stop to is to keep shoting until they fall down and stop moving.

If she was in so much fear of the grandson why didn't she call the police or a social agency??? Her way to solve the "problem" was to kill him!!!!

Granny did him a favor he would have just went to prison to be someone ho, what are they going to do to her put her in the prison nursing home so they can get her SS check17, on parole and on drugs....more to the story here.....Parents In AZ because they couldn't handle him either...

Yes, she was probably scared.  Unfortunately, I think the self-defense claim went out the window when HE fled and SHE pursued and fired again and again.  Forget her age and the fact that this is a grandmother.. if this was a man who did the same, he would be found guilty.That being said, her behavior is typical of someone who was constantly being abused or threatened.  I think voluntary manslaughter is in order; definitely not 1st degree murder.

This is a tough one. Having that gun handy gave it a certain end.

some parents are prisoners in their own homes afraid of their children who are on drugs.

No pictures, no story, no school records, no friends testifying, no report of his arrest records. No story period. This is NEWS?

I thought Grandma's made lasagna and cookies? Now if you don't listen- they're popping caps in your #$%$ !!

Her first words to police...I murdered, I shot, I killed, because he wouldn't listen.  That confession pretty much sums it up in my mind - GUILTY !!!

So she shot at a un armed man 10 times?  Hit him with 6 shots. Self defense?

F*** it, shoot him again. Especially if he was a Democrat.

Ever heard the term an old witch??? This lady was possesed. It was pre meditated. Old or not she is guilty.Over a six minute period? Everytime he moved, she shot him again? Surely he was subdued with the first few shots. That sounds like first degree murder.

Guns don't kill rather, grandmother's kill.

Article says that she shot 10 times, how many bullets struck him?  Two it seems based on the story.  Tough love for sure, but I hope she's telling the truth, for this is one sad case to be serving as a juror.

as the old saying goes, leave no witness and thats just what she did!

#$%$ this is weird

10 times? just because she is a old woman, doesnt mean she isnt evil

"shot at him 10 times over a six-minute span""'I'm going to die,' the 17-year-old said before he was shot again"he might not have died if she hadn't kept shooting...people's comments are exclaiming this is acceptable behavior... killing a kid is disgusting, and cheering for it is foolish at best

And let's not forget our ally, Afghanistan, supplies 90%+ of the opium that makes heroin.

It stopped being self defense when the teen went to call 911. She could have used that time to lock herself in another room, or even leave the house. But no, she went after him for more.

I guess the young punk had to learn the hard way that you don't mess with Granny.Robert Hassan /Hilly Billy      Grand Mother Blue Top  91/ Grand Mother said I murdered, I shot,I killed my grand son but she didn't mention grand son  attacked on her,2/She was a lonely  woman because she said to 911 that her grand son wanted to run away from her home ,3/ She felt insecure 4/ Sounds like both of them were addicted in drugs 6/ It is call " GRAND MOTHER BLUE " 7/  she was carrying a gun that was legal or illegal that is the question,8/ One NRA supporter.9/Obama speechless to hear that

That Grandson must have mistreated his Grandmother, for her to take drastic measures!

Fry her.

Boo Hoo! FN raisin faced cold blooded murderer. Kill this monster. She has no business breathing air. Cold blooded demon.

she did not need to shoot 9 times.story says 3,reporter says 9.so what is it,you take one shot to stop the assault.Hit the leg or arm or shoulder.she intentionally wanted to kill.

There are so many things wrong with her version of events it isn't even funny. Just b/c she's a little old lady doesn't automatically make her a good person. She was in a safe place in her own bedroom, but went up 3 flights of stairs and started shooting her grandson while he was in the bathroom.She then went downstairs to the basement and reloaded while he called 911 to try and get help. She then went ALL the way back upstairs and finished him off while on the phone with 911. You can actually hear him dying as he begged for help. Even the 911 operator who testified cried real tears when describing that phone call. When granny testified, she did one of those "crying acts" but never shed one single tear. Not one. She's guilty of murder. (AND there was no indication whatsoever that he laid a finger on her when she was examined at the hospital immediately afterwards.)

"She said she shot him after he struck her during an argument over money that he had demanded from her so he could flee Michigan"  and ."....a call that Layne made to police two months before Hoffman was killed. Sounding desperate and anguished, she said she needed help because her grandson wanted to run away from her home."    So if she so was afraid of him, why not just let him run away?

Does she have a "license to kill" or not ?  The government does.

One bullet was not enough?

"She killed a child she was trying to protect and trying to save."Gee, I hope no one tries to protect or save me.10 shots? she needs to do some time

Why did she commit overkill?  Fear.  It's a great motivator, but turning all those gunshots into self defense is going to be the problem.  It's a d#mn shame he had to be killed by his own Grandmother instead of the thugs in thug-ville that self destruct quite nicely.

Why were the words "hunted down"  and  "massacre"  used in the writing of  this story?  They seem to be building a case in the news story  for pre influencing and precieved judgement  for conviction of this woman even before she went to trial and both sides of this  story were presented in a court of law??????( Am I wrong in my opinion of the way this story was written with phrases like 'hunted down,  and "massacre"  used in it??Just wondering???

A 75 year old grandmother trying to deal with a substance-abusing grandson, who was about to have his parole revoked, and returned to jail, was trying to obtain money, and possibily her car,  for the purpose of fleeing the jurisdiction, and had been threatened and intimated for many months.  She had previously called 911 begging for help and had been refused.  What other course did she have open to her??

She had enough

He wasn't running away from home, he was wanting her money to run from probation. I am a 77 year old grandma and my grandson has stolen from everyone in the family and will soon get out of jail for drugs. He would do anything when he is wanting drugs. If she hadn't killed him dead he would come after her. Unless you have been there you cannot judge. They bring the druggies to your house and take everything you own. Calling the law does not help. They just take the report.

So if she got away with it once won't she justify doing it again. Put her in a rest home. Take away her rights to bear arms.

The punk got what he deserved, his parents ought to go to jail for pushing him off on his grandmother to begin with.

SOUNDS like a older women living in fear from past events and he must have crossed the line this time/ but the DA woundn't know that cause he's not living in fear like she was / drug users don't care who they hurt to get what they want ////////////////////

If anyone thinks they can render a decision on guilt or innocent from what's provided in this article, they're kidding themselves.Sigh.... travisty he just might be alive today had she been limited to 6 shots huh

Shooting your grandson 6 times some while he is still on the phone with 911 begging for help doesn't really sound like self defense. The prosecutor must think he has a srong case for 1st degree murder or you would think this would be a case for some type of plea bargain.

what did that boy do???

Well he wanted to flee Michigan so his grandmother sent him to hell.

Man, how I feel for this woman...she not only killed her grandson but she's facing dying in prison...911 is always the best option unless you're being attacked...

He tried to threaten her to get money to flee Michigan for a parole violation and assaulted her.  I say it was a good shoot.

Calling 911 because your grandson wants to run away from you isn't the same as calling 911 because you are afraid of your grandson.

It's been ages since I've known the law on this... But I can't remember... Can you get Social Security Benefits while in prison?   Think about it... Granny might be raking in money AND have better medical care then Medicare!   PLUS she can feel free knowing that someone out there is more safe than if her drugged up grandkid is off the planet.Synthetic Drug use isn't like the natural stuff.  More times than not it increases violence.I've seen Cash registers that were bolted to counter tops ripped out by people hopped up on drugs.  Those people normally couldn't rip a stack of 10 pieces of paper in half.

the Q is should she be held accountable?...if this had been grandpa...the media would be calling him evil.

crazy old grannyThis old lady was probable scared to death. There is no telling what treats he made to her and or pushed her around. Put yourself in her shoes at 74 years old and some kid you know has been in trouble with the law and uses drugs is demanding money or else. At that age your clinging to life and it don't take much to scare the hell out of you.

She fired six shots, he's begging for his life. She's afraid of him &amp; he tells the dispatcher he's going to die. She claims it was self-defense because he was high &amp; abusive. He was planning of going to a bonfire with friends. Where is the truth in this mess? We may never know for sure.

murder one---no doubt she planned to murder him---the parents should not left him with grandma---they bear some responsibility.

Does it really matter at this point?  Two lives are ruined...

If you can't trust grandma who can you trust?

The Pistol Packin' Granny.

Next article will be about  busting up a 7year old Girl Scout's Drug Ring.

that is one mean little g'ma. look at those beady little eyes. don't let the blue hair fool you. over the river and thru the woods to grandmother's house to get shot....

Take her out back and shoot her.

She called 911 previously because "he wanted to leave the house" , not, stay, mooch off and terrorize her.  He wanted to LEAVE.   Perhaps she was afraid for him, not of him.  She did not have grounds to repeatedly shoot him.  This was a control issue and he would have stood a better chance out on the street.  Instead, she lost control and put him down with bullets. She displayed llogical, irrational, unstable behavior.  Some role model she was.  It appears she shot him in an emotional moment then, instead of taking responsibility for her stupidity, she silenced him..Also, just because someone has gray hair doesn't mean they suddenly become this wise, compassionate person.  An 80-yr-old with a gun is just as dangerous as a 20-yr-old with a gun.She was wrong.and, as a result, a child is dead.   Had she ever heard of Al-Anon or Nar-Anon?She had the Gun,She had a high defensive weapon,she could have Fled,Just another cold,mean blooded Battle ax,I have seen hundreds living in Trailer Parks,shoot you just aswell as look at you,PURE MEAN!

Parents need to be charged for dumping their POS kid on the grandparents!

" Should she be held criminaly responsible for his death " ?  What a question--!She was either afraid, very stupid or just plain evil .  Pathologically vengeful, I'd say . He could'nt have been more frightening than she is .

When an old person is in fear for their life,from a family ,member they have every right to use deadly force. Too much elderly abuse goes unreported and much is ignored by the police when reported. When you fear from a person who you once loved and protected it breaks your heart,but you must do what is best for your self and to protect others.

Don't believe it was self-defense,sounds like she was mad and went crazy.

He didn't listen!!!!!!! So thats an excuse to kill him! If we all did like her there would be no teenages or children. Shes a killer.

lock her up and throw away the key. oh wait, if Casey Anthony can get away with it, so can she.

I was a plumbing residential repairman for over the 30+ years and was shocked at how many grandparents that raised grandchildren,..And have seen many times with my own eyes how the grandparents have no control over these children,....At times it was a recipe for disaster,...My heart goes out to them,...it's not easy.

I don't think you can do much to a 75 year old... they don't give a Rat's #$%$ what you do.

Tough love.So what did she shoot him with, a 9 or a forty?

Granny's out of control.

What defense does a 75 year old have against a 17 year old.....Absent Parents!

Maybe they should let kids be spanked again

So much for that kid raising a grand parent

How many times we see this.  Grandparents raising their grandkids.  Sickening!You notice that the kid was on PROBATION!  And now we see possible drug use.  Was the kid on probation before she took him in?IF I had a kid in my house like that I'd have called the parents and told them to get this  rotten piece of garbage out of my house!"so-called synthetic marijuana"  well, was it or wasn't it in his system?  We see how that stuff messes with the mind.   IF I were in my grandparents house back in the old days when they were alive.  I would have been beaten over the body black and blue by a 2x4 or baseball bat for doing crud like that.I really doubt that granny had any issues, or mom and dad wouldn't have left the kid there.  OR are they bad parents and didn't give a flying frig about the kid?With the lack of information on this case.  I'm still swaying towards siding with granny.   Probation and drug use vs little old lady, they'd hate me on a jury.

Whatever happened to that survival mentality?  Just cause you're hit doesn't mean you're out of the fight.  As long as you're still breathing, you've got a chance to stop the threat.In this case, it was a dirty, old bag.  Too bad he couldn't get the gun away from her.

Ma Barker!

Oh yeah, she killed him in cold blood.   Just read what she said to cops when they arrived. It wasn't he beat me, it was "I murdered. I shot. I killed ".  She knew what she did.  Anything saying the boy struck her is just the defense trying to get off.  I have a hard time believing a 17 year old could hit an old lady and not mess up her glasses or leave ANY marks on her at all.

addiction is a biyatch it was all fun til granny got a gun  were was his mom/dad you know the story I don't need to bring up the obviousGEEEZ....The worst my Grandma ever did as punishment was "hit" me with a broom - and that was comical....R.I.P. Grandma!

Did she really have to kill him? NO  2 months before the shooting she called the cops is when the parents should have came and got their son. If she was fearful why was he still there? Involuntary man slaughter sounds right.

She did the right thing a 75 yr old against a drugged 17yr old the parents should be on trail for not taken care of there son, thats what a parent is for they had him RAISE HIM

I doubt she gets more than ten years if she's convicted.

It's a sad situation. My neighbor is like that. Divorced mom, struggling to make ends meet and the teenage son is under house arrest for drinking and driving off with the mom's car, many many times. Victims all around, not good. This old lady has suffered enough. Let her go.

Wasn't this Grandson trying to get money from his grandmother for drugs?  When his need for the  drugs and his  craving for  the drugs got stronger  how far   would he go to get the  money from  his grandma for his drug needs?  Was that possibly what was  happening  that day at Grandmother's house????  Just wondering?Let Grandmother tell her side of the story.   She should be allowed to present her side for her defense.   And shouldn't she  be considered innocent until proven guilty in a court of law?

if she's afraid of him - send him back to one of his parents or authorities will arrange foster home or something for him - not hunt him down &amp; shoot him

hell no this bo-atch is wicked! 10 times over 6 minutes and he was still a threat assuming shes not lying about feeling scared. hes on the phone with 911 and you still shoot him. this ho is not straight.

Hate to over-generalize, but drugged up kids threatening elders is becoming a norm. Then they cry foul when the elder has had enough and says "NO!". I'm with grandma on this one.

She shares the same fate as the terrorist.  They should beoth be dead now.A seventeen year old is not a child, except in the eyes of the defense.  They reach puberty younger now, around age seven, so adulthood should be adjusted downward to say, 13 or 14.  Anything else is outdated thinking.

She had him because neither parent could handle him so they dumped him on grandma. It's happening all over the U.S. Grandma should have demanded the parents come and get him or called police saying she could not handle him.

if you let them , they will come live off you. big mistake. he needed to be in jail. she probably saved some young girl from being abused and murdered someday.

I can see a reasonable arguement for both sides. One thing for sure, I would not like to be on the jury. Tough decision.

Too bad for granny, but it sounds like she did the rest of us a favor, and made the world a little safer, and better one thug at a time.

So what was she suppose to do?  Call 911 while her out of control 17 year grandson Beat the #$%$ out of here for dope money?  I'm sure this lady lived 75 years so she could kill here grandson.  Let her go, give her the an Award, sound like she has aided the community.  WHO KNOWS, he could have been your next shooter at you local school.  Drugs and a 17 year ? brain.     Let her go, 911 got there in what 20 minutes?

You have to see some of the experiences old people go through at the hands of their grand kids to understand the situation that they are often put in. The fact that his parents had more or less abandoned him speaks for itself. They apparently couldn't control him so they put him out. I know of a seventy five year old woman who has a twenty year old grandson who has almost bankrupted her. His mother died seven years ago and his father has never been interested in him. He has maxed out all of her credit cards, has amassed over two thousand dollars in tickets and ripped off one of her bank accounts for seven thousand dollars and this is just the monies she has told us about. He didn't finish high school, so he is virtually unemployable. He has not exhibited any violate tendencies as yet but he his verbally abusive. I think she should be convicted of involuntary manslaughter and given a suspended sentence, sent back home to live out her remaining years in a modicum of peace.

Tragedy.

Wow! dont mess with Mamaw!

Robert Hassan /Grand Ma is NRA supporter   Top 81 / Grand mother is NRA SUPPORTER 2/ Both were Marijuana addicted  3/ Joe Biden hate to hear that story because of gun 3/ Cold Blooded murder 4/ It was not a self defense 5/ It was hate crime between two different age .6/ Granny says I need to stay in prison with free medicare 7/ Grand mother says I love worry free life in Prison 8/ No grand children bother mekids on drugs are unpredictable, she did what she did for a reason, we weren't there we have no right to judge....I know from my own experience and a busted face kids on drugs are crazy you dont know what they are capable of till they come at ya.........

I think she is an angry old woman......really more then one shot?  She meant to have him dead why didn't she leave the house when he was on the phone with 911 someone would have come she had him down and she meant to keep him there

Maybe Granny just didn't want to share her stash of glaucoma weed....

I say arm all the Grandmothers and maybe we can get rid of all these druggies!

She could have just "winged him"..........shooting 10 times is a little overkill,  that's one tough old lady.

Should have shot him and dragged him to Florida!

kids killing kids, kids killing parents, parents killing kids, grand parents killing kids, this world has gone to Hell and it may be to late

I would not want to be on that jury.I have a feeling that she was terrorized by this kid and killed him in self defense. This is not just a case of some one that had "snapped".

This is why elderly women cannot give birth.  Rearing children is too stressful for someone in her 70's.  Why didn't one of the kids parents take him?  Because he was out of control and difficult to raise, that's why.  So he gets dumped on grandma.

Good thing Granny didn't have one of those AR15's.  She might have shot up the neighborhood.   GUNS DON"T KILL.  PEOPLE DO!Fry granny.

Sandra caught grandson Jonathan parading around the guest room wearing her 15  year old panty girdle.  She was alright until she realized that her grandson was also wearing her corrective heels, and eye shadow!

GUILTY! Plain &amp; simple. He's not here to dispute her claims &amp; self defense is not a believable  scenario since she continued to shoot him after he was down &amp; absolutely no threat to her life.

Why did she have to shot him 6 times ?? Really ! come on , he was on the the phone with the POLICE begging for help. She could have walked away, wouldn't have even had to run to get to safety.....  SHE KILLED HIM, COLD BLOODED MURDER..... nuf said

This is obviously not the entire story. First of all, how is a 17 yr old going to get a "parole violation" under ANY circumstances?? Also, she called "911" because her grandson "wanted to run away?"  How exactly is that fearing for HER life? Sounds like he feared for HIS life in my opinion. She should be put to death even if she was 105!!

Fire up old sparky!

moral of the story,parents continue to fail to raise their kids,kids continue to think they can act anyway they please....and "old people" DO finally find their breaking points. Something for everyone to really think about. We all have that person inside who can take just so much before we snap...remember little girls and boys....you keep pushing....and even "grannie" will push back......

i would jump in fire before i would hurt my grand children

This young man was out of control, it was him or her, pick one.

This drug addict had probably terrorized this woman and she was fed up!!!!  Surprised it doesn't happen more often!!!Another beautiful display of the "time out" generation.

Instead of stopping to call 911, he should have got out of range, dummie!

With so many of the kids in this country on drugs and out of control,there is little wonder she shot him, I may have done the same thing.If you have never seen a kid  on drugs and going crazy then don't judge this woman because there is no explaining the fear one faces at times like this and most of the time the kid don't even remember doing it later.There was one girl here that beat, robbed and killed her Grandma and put her body in the garbage and all because she was high on drugs and wanted another fix.

If you are thinking about murder chances are you are listening to the DEVIL! VIOLENCE IS never the answer!

Is there any way we can convict the parents of something?  Anything.  I am of the opinion that this kid was outta control and the old lady was scared.  That being said, 6 times?  SIX TIMES she shot him.

Something stinks here.

I had a neighbor who had her son at an older age and he would come home drugged, steal from her ATM machine and throw things at her and she would put up with his abuse. Until one morning he drove right by my house, waved to me at 7am as I was heading to work....didn't even know he had killed his elderly mother and was carrying her in the back seat. She died a horrible death because he wanted money to support his habit and she thought she could change him. Sad sad day for all the neighbors...my point, we don't know how this young man was treating his grandmother and he just pushed her over the edge or she was just afraid for her life! Killing wasn't the answer but sometimes people don't know how to get help or too ashamed to let others know what is happening behind closed doors!

Heard he still wasn't listening to her.

A world going crazy, with no hope of it's own. For as long as there is a devil, Jesus is our only answer.

Once an "assailant" is running in the other direction seeking help, it's no longer self defense.Lock her up.

Let grandma go. She did the world a favor!

Ah, let the old woman go.  She saved us countless years of arresting, prosecuting, jailing and feeding a future inmate.  Those old timers live by a different set of rules than we do these days.

After hitting him the first 5 times, didn't she think that was enough.

If more elderly had guns there would be more respect.  "Dont mess with Granny"Let her go. He deserved it for hitting her. Self defense

If you ever dial 911 instead of running then you are stupid.

Granny is going to the big house.....2nd degree murder! Bet she remembers now!!!!

Aim for the head grandma !!!!! This is silly if there has been a history of drugs and violence than he died of occupational hazards and nothing more , and if any bleeding hearts feel different why don't you take a drug addict into your home and see what it is to deal with a violent one and see if your feeling the same way !

Liberal media,need to butt out let her go and live in peace which she hasn't had in a while.

if you have seen troubled teens lately they are pure animals and i am sure she did what she had to do. i say put the parents on trial for making the grandmother take over there duties.women don't kill....guns do.

once again this should have never went to court

Too many Dirty Harry movies ..?

I would set her free if I were on that jury.  Today parents are absent and drugs rule grandkids.  They won't work so they torment their grandparents for money.  I have seen it countless times.  The way I look at it,..... one less drug addict in the world suckin the system dry and a gun saves a life from a "punk" kid who terrorizes the elderly.

My brother was like this boy and he terrorized me and our grandmother for years...if I had been old enough I would have done the world a favor and shot him myself. He went on to kill another man and ruin my father financially. He was a bad seed from the start. My grandmother didn't have the gumption of this woman.

Shot 10 times over six minutes.  That's not self defence.  She could have left the house after the first couple shots.  Sounds like torture to me.

I can kind of relate to this.  I have a cousin who has a drug problem and constantly is calling all of us for money and he tries to take advantage of my grandma so much by asking for money and to ask if she can make him food, but he just blows her off every time.  I could see where if you possibly have an addiction problem which he does, things could eventually heat up because clearly he is just trying to get money from her for more drugs.  Only difference is my grandma doesn't own a gun nor could she ever kill someone.

Let her go.

she murdered that boy because after the first shot she could have fled to a safe place called the cops and reported the incident, he was on the phone with 911 so seems to me he was the scared one and with no evidence of a struggle she better go down a heartless murder to kill your family take a lot and she must have no heart to kill a kid

Fear built up over a long period of time can do some damage to your thought process for sure.She was probably scared and tired to death of the lechter. Self-Defense !Let her go live the rest of her life in peace.

Old women in America are crazy old hoarders

What's wrong with that prosecutor, doesn't he have a grandma or does he beat her on a regular basis?

How could you keep shooting someone who is begging for help?  she's nuts.Maybe the whole family is nuts.  She makes grandmas looks bad.But his parents make mothers and fathers look worse.  Where are they?

Grandmas just aren't like they used to be...

The last time I heard it is criminal to shoot someone 10 times over a 6 minute period. But I'm from the south and folks say we are antiquated down here - maybe in Michigan it's OK to do that these days.

There are some in the world who need this to happen to chased down and shot. To bad she didn't have a extended magazine or reloaded make the lad suffer even more.

The judge said to the jury they could acquit her even if her thought that he was going to do her great physical harm was wrong.  Boy, what a chance for wholesale killings from now on. Oh, I thought my husband , who was sleeping on the couch, was planning to kill me when he woke up even though he hasn't harmed me in 30 years of marriage. I'm sorry I was wrong but that's what I thought.  Well then my dear, if you thought that was going to happen you can go home even though you were wrong. C'mon, who cares what she thought.  I was given a traffic ticket in L.A. because I made a left turn and a car coming down the other street hit his brakes because he THOUGHT I was close enough his car could be struck. I measured the distance and brought it to court and the judge looking at the distance decided the other car would have to travel 200 MPH to hit me.  The driver wasn't good in judging distance due to inability to drive correctly. I was acquitted because the OTHER person was wrong in thinking I could have hit him.  I was the victim, he thought wrong thus my ticket wasn't valid due to his thought processes were wrong.  The judge of this killing case would have found me guilty even though this stupid driver made a dumb decision and hit his brakes for no legitimate reason. If she thought wrong it was HER mistake and should be found guilty of being so stupid she caused a young person to lose their life. However, she is old, a female, living alone, and doesn't use drugs so she'll walk while the young man goes to his grave because a dumb woman thought wrong. This is not justice. Justice makes a person responsible for their behavior for it is the behavior that counts and not whether or not she thought wrong. Her mental behavior was not the young man's fault.  She should go to jail and stay there till she dies.

Why in the hell would the parents send a drug using troubled teen to live with a 70+ year old woman? You made the child, stand up and be a parent!!!!

She is not sorry. She just doesn't want to eat prison food.Bleeding heart for this teenager who probably felt he could rule his grandmother.  He was multiple times stronger than she &amp; because he messed his life up &amp; wanted her money to get away, his provocation has now ruined her life.  This is the DR SPOCK world of young people who have no shame.  The parents who are too afraid of being a parent and BUSTIN' some BUTT as they are growing up now are having to meet this kind of life in the years they should be enjoying their family the most.  After 23 years of teaching, I found children were more secure in an environment that had boundaries and not "no-no's" or "time out".  Discipline administered in a loving way will shape a child not warp them like this society is producing.  It's like the lines on the highway.  They are there to keep you secure in you journey.  I vote for the Grandmother.  The young buck should have been out working instead of badgering his grandmother to bail him out.  GRRRRRR... the more I think about it the worse it gets.   All I can say is GO GRANNY, GO!!!

If the parents had give a demn about somebody besides themselves, the boy might still be alive today.Too many people think it is perfectly AOK to get married, have kids, then divorce, not stopping for one second to consider the kid.My Way or the Highway,Big I, little u.

Family is great, and love is nice, but if my Grandma freaked out and started shooting at me like that?  Well, she'd be "away on a long cruise" and I'd be driving her Caddy.

I have many feelings about this case..........first I have a problem with parents who dump there kids on there parents......Rich white folks do it because they don't have "time....poor black folks do it because they don't have "money" ............Both are lame.......But what bothers me about the grandmother is that she shot the boy and then as he walks alway to call 911 for help she shots him a few more times....How can you let that walk??

OJ gets off, but we want blood for granny, who takes care of her grandson.  Where are the parent's?  I say Jury Nullification for Grandmother, Like OJ's Jury.  She's 70.  She didn't deserve to have this obviously troubled kid dumped in her lap, but the facts are that there are thousands of "Granny's" raising troubled children for their own troubled, drug addicted, mentally ill children.  The courts do not act, when action is called for, they wait.  How many times did this grandmother ask for assistance? From this child's parent's? did she know community services were available? where was the help for her?  I agree with her attorney, she was afraid of him.  LET GRANNY GO FREE and GET HER SOME COUNSELING !!

Very poorly written article ED.

I'm glad I never tested either of my Grandmothers. Yep I would have been fish food.

If she was so damned afraid of the kid she should have just let him leave.

Since she had problems with the kid before why didn't she give him to the state of turn him in to juvenile authorities? Isn't that more sane than killing him? She's just and angry person and was sick of his #$%$ and blew him away. The repeated shots even after he was on the phone denotes anger/rage in my opinion, the same as Jodi Arias!

Gun totin' gramma.  I think there's a lot more to this than her defense attorney wants to admit.Complications in a family can and do turn deadly. It happens frequently.  He should have been living with his parents. I would not know how to decide her fate. A woman that age is very vulnerable and can act out of a fear that grows and overwhelms her. I think there should be a different type of facility for the elderly that are in this type of situation. Not in a prison with hardened criminals. But not being there and not knowing the whole story of the event and what caused it I decline to pass judgement.

love all the ignorant comments.

he probably deserved it..should have had the police evict himmm?? but then again, these kids are hoodlums look at  Ohio..

get the noose ready.... 75 or 25 you don't shoot and then keep shooting anyone ten times... no wonder he tried to flee two months earlier.... hang her up

He beats grandma silly, steals her money, jumps in her car and kills your loved one. Different scenario now, isn't it?Grandma may have saved your loved one's life.

I hope she gets off.

Doesn't sound like murder 1 to me. She sounds  like she had been abused by the sleazy drug crazed teenager and he deserved to be removed from society by any means necessary.

If I was 78 and a 17 year old hit me.....Too old to fight him so .... Id shoot his #$%$ too.

I am willing to bet he was bullying this woman.

She will probably get off scott free,Today's juries are soooo Stupid!Guilty.

she kept shooting because she was afraid that if he recovers he will come after her, and she got rid of a drug addict. she is no criminal just afraid.

Lets see, she's 75 yrs old and he was 17 yrs old. HMMMM...He was a punk and most likely threatened her and she was defending herself. If she had not shot him she would be dead and he would be on trial for murder. One less criminal off the street....

Lets pray for this grandmother.  Fear is fear.  No one will ever know this type of fear unless your faced with it.  Grandmas always try to help. She will live with this for the rest of her life. God speed.

If it had been grandpa and a granddaughter there would be no dought that gradpa was in the wrong.  Just look at the facts.  She shot him not once, or twice, but SIX times. Some of those shots were while the gradson was on the phone to the police telling them that she was killing him.  Just look at the facts and not the speculations about how the grandson was some kind of monster.

Well here we go again. An elderly person trying to get away with murder because she feels entitled because of her age. She belongs in prison.

If she was worried SHE should have called the cops not taken matters in her own hands SHE'S A MURDERER - PERIOD!

When a tree grows crooked, the best is to take it down before it hurts anyone.

Death sentence for killer granny

Multiculture and loss of morals from Kosher Hollywood= SOCIAL MISERYIn my book, grandmothers do not go around shooting their grandchildren for NO REASON.She will have to live with that scenario for the rest of her life.That is UNDESERVED punishement.Children today are taught about "rights" but not about R-E-S-P-E-C-T .

These damn teens are fearless now.  they will take their families to the cleaners.  they will do anything to get money. If they get angry they jump on the parents. They show very little respect now.

Let Grandma go.  Grandma's give up their lives to try to raise grandkids who many times abuse them for money and drugs and nothing is done about it.

how could the parents leave him with the grandmother? they obviously didn't want to deal with his problems.

crazy old lady. you're going to prison

she seems demented. one shot, maybe 2 is self defense. hunting someone down and shooting them 10 times with the final shot while they're calling 911 is murder.

Grandma Dearest !!!!

HELL They just gave two Juveniles (16&amp;17) 1yr for Raping a totally Drunk Girl.  This Older Lady was way more justified in Killing the Grandson.  She deserves about 6 Months Probation.

You shoot once or maybe twice in self defense. 10 times makes you go hummm?

She will get life in prison even if it is just 5 years, she is old and not going to make it long in prison unless she bakes Grandma's Cookies and poisons anyone who looks at her wrong.  Murder is Murder last I checked give this crazy old bitty the chair!Before you assume grandma is innocent, read these FACTS.*Jonathan was shot/killed while on the phone with the 911 operator begging for his life.*Sandra told her husband to take the dog for a walk right before the shooting*No one, not even her husband, knew she had purchased a gun.*Forensic scientists testified that the drug(K-2) was NOT affecting the grandson's brain or behavior on the day he was killed.*Jonathon's parents were not told about any problems between Jonathan and his grandmother. Sandra Layne never asked for their help or intimated that her grandson was more than she could handle.

Poor Grandma. I'd bet she would have shot him 50 times with a bigger clip, because she was scared. You can't imagine how scared a 74 year old, tiny, woman would be- who was kicked and beaten by this drugged freak. At least he won't do it again.

Shoot him again to make sure.

Could things get any weirder?  Synthetic pot....gun toting Grand mothers...

She didn't have to kill him!

one shot the person is down he is now a controlled threat you the gun holder is in control to shoot him 10 times it is murder that was planed methodically.

She could have just given him some money and never seen him again. No need to murder him. If everybody went around murdering those who they fear..we'd have 10 times more murders.

She HUNTED him down and SHOT HIM TEN TIMES. Who was afraid of who?

I don't care if they have a photo of granny crying, the kid was on the phone calling for help and she shot him again, put a picture of that up, but his face looked worse.

I can't believe those sympathizing with the old woman.  This is a woman capable of shooting this boy repeatedly, I'm thinking she was abusive to begin with, and she raised one of his parents that abondaned him, one of the articles said it she could be heard asking him if he wanted a drink of water before shooting him again.  She is evil.Regadless of what she says...can't prove anything, her grandson is dead! I understand he may had been "giving her a run for the money"...my oldeest kind put me throught the same thing. I didn't shoot her!!! She should have picked up the phone and called 911...no self defense she kept shooting him after he was down. Send granny away...

Free Granny.

no one knows untill you walk in the other person's shoes!!!  i was taught when you don't know what to do , do nothing only later in life  i found that is not alway's a good lesson. i am now older than this lady 80. by my living god's grace is this  not me. i raised twin sons alone after their father decided he wanted different. they were sick babies but good children.  one went into the marines they other navy. the best they could be. what happened? life  as they chose. marine son now with mother after 2 marriages. they last took all but his life. not only disabled but  suicidel, on 2 depression pills dailey and 1 for sleep at knight,dying from smoking.  navy son. became drug addicted.discharged after a wall many times. i paid for airline ticked and i used a pass since i worked for  airline, and took him to ship. jailed many times.mother never paid dime for lawyer. i could'nt count on fingers and toes how many time i've picked them and carried them to va hospitals from va to fl. yes i too have weept for strength to  shoot no one but three. and would have had they raised their hand or voice to me. navy son is doing as well as he is capibal. navy son is in jail where has been most of his adult life. this time for stealing  his mother's car. the mother that prayed for his life when doctor's said they could not survive. premies wk 3.8 and 3.10. they are still alive. i thank god every day i did not do as this dear grandmother. there is now way i could have endured what she did. judge not, les ye be judged.  reguardless of where she spendes the rest of her years on this earth i'm sure my god has a special place for her. lord be with you.

turn the gas burner on high and fry her

Probably a little senility at play here. The aging mind misreads all sorts of things. Aggression,hostility and combative behavior is common in old age homes. A sign of dementia.

he had did a lot of other stuff....SHE SNAPPED, just to keep shooting? Yeah, SNAPPED

those of you pointing out how many times she shot, MOST amateurs, lay people, women, people in fear often keep shooting until no bullets are left. The gun becomes a method to stop the threat even after the threat no longer exists.

in the military they just keep on shooting...grandma had the right idea

More to the story.....She didnt just snap  Takes alot to kill your grandson. One bullet or ten

Not guilty. She continued to shoot until he was rendered harmless, and that extends to the near-certain retaliation he would inflict.I guess you would not call that postal...  maybe grannyed?

sad to hear but it sounds like she did what she had to do to protect her self

If memaw goes medieval on your hind end, that probably qualifies a "He needed killin'."

Unless she was personally threatened, Amerika, guess who loses... &amp; silly answers to the above will prove my next point as Detroit becomes more like the "ROBOCOP" of decades ago while you denizens of the above do nothing to fix this #$%$, so...

Detroit?  She's yet another liberal democrat out slaughtering people.

He wanted to leave months ago, instead of letting him go she sends Hubby on errands and hunts the boy down and kills him in cold blood. Hang the hag, no selfdefense in this case......jmo...

I hope they aquit her. The kid was probably an abusive #$%$ who made her feel threatened all the time. Too bad she got stuck with caring for the brat.

Anybody who hits their grandma to get money deserves to be shot.

can i shoot the old hag 10 times as a penalty? fair is fair

This is a horrible situation! I feel really bad for the lady...she appears so remorseful, and I believe she is! She did not want this to happen, but so many teens now a days can become in to monsters at the drop of a hat, and especially once they get involved with drugs! Wanting to try her with a sentence of possible " Life  " is ridiculous under these circumstances! Had he killed his grandmother, I am sure the boy would have gotten off on a lesser charge, being young and first offense, along with influence of drugs! Not Fair! This lady is also a first time offense, and was fighting for her life! The one statement of ... " Why did she not just ask him to leave ....? " seriously, ask any cop what many are like under the influence...they are hard to detain, more less hard to physically control, how is a 75 year old small lady suppose to physically control, more less detain a teen age punk who is out of control and assaulting his grandmother already!? I seriously hope a extremely good attorney steps in to represent this lady, she deserves the help and support! The judicial system needs to realize this lady has two loses now...her grandson [ whom she loved and feared ] and now her freedom is gone!poor lady

Getting whippings with extention cords isn't that bad after all.

Give grandma a medal and some more ammo and drop her off at the mall.

Poor lady. Free her now!!!!!!

its weird times and folks are lost in spacey situations ,,letting someone into your home as a gesture of kindness then you cant rid yourself of them the law will arrest you you must go through all kinds of beurocratic #$%$ and by the time the abuse moves your lucky if your not in the looney bin. its the law that is at fault for this terrible end of life

This is a tough one. I would say if he's on the phone with 911 pleading for help and being shot while doing so that is likely not self defense on her part.That said, what brought her to fire at all? If he did threaten her, she being a weak and elderly lady and he a spry young man, the disparity of force may well have lead her to draw and fire at a large and intimidating young man who would easily have wounded or killed her otherwise that may have been advancing on her with malice.Tough one to judge.I've no desire to sit on that jury.

just because she's old, she still can be a killer .

Got sick of that thug.

well one thing for sure granny can count to 10 in six minutes

Sorry, she killed him.  She shot him six time over a 10 minute period while he asked for help and called 911 and they kept questioning him probably thinking it was a joke, even after hearing the shoots over and over again....Right!!She was scared because he kept screaming in pain and it was messing with her ears.... so she'ed shoot him again, again, and again until he shut-up!!"it was self defense... that's why it took me 10 shots and 6 minutes to shoot him to death... while he begged for help.... he was still attacking me... you just couldn't hear it over his screams and the gunshots..."

Really six times while he's on the phone to 911 begging for help. Please she's out of control

If Gramma was that afraid - why didn't she call 911 instead of killing her own grandson ????

The kid was a miscreant. She did society a favor.

judges take the title &amp; the pay &amp; give jurors their job &amp; danger -  government rob &amp; killthose who are not employ/not fully funtioning member of society at the time, are not qualify to be called to serve or vote - skip them

I am sorry but I call BS on the self defense. She shot this kid whole he was on the phone with 911. He had been running through the house trying to get away from her. Even if he has struck her which doesn't seem the case as she had no marks, you do not shoot him. Knock him back but not shoot him. This crazy woman had this plan and the little grandma, old lady act wouldn't work on me.  I really hope she gets what she deserves because despite her age she is a cold blooded killer! All of you saying it sounded like she got sick of his BS are sick, it doesn't matter what this kid did, he didn't deserve to be hunted through the house like an animal. He needed treatment and help not death.

First off, she didn't 'hunt him down' if they were in her own home. I believe that she was scared of him and did the only thing she could do which was save herself.  Absolutely a case of self defense. And shame on the parents for foisting him an elderly woman to take care of.  Her own feelings of what happened will be enough punishment, no jail time is necessary.

It's not "self-defence" if she did not try to leave or call 911.  She slaughtered him as an executioner.  She'll spend the rest of her life in jail.  Just because you get angry in retaliation for being hit doesn't give you the right to play "punisher", God, judge, jury and executioner.  This is a land of laws, not Rule-By-Fist as you see fit. That rotten apple of a loser grandson of hers didn't fall far from the tree.

The thing that gets me is that she shot him again while he was on the phone with 911. How is that an act of self defense at that point in time? She should not be acquited, I think the minimum verdit should be voluntary manslaughter.

In my opinion, 85 or more percent of women who kill men do so out of fear, retribution, or self-defense.This poor lady needs help.  I think he just drove her nuts.  Thank his drinkin' and druggin' buddies?

I would shoot myself before I ever shot my grandkid!

Need to get back to good American values such as the Waltons  LIttle House on Praire and Wednesday night prayer meetings

At 74 years old, I doubt this woman is healthy enough to defend herself against a 17 year old and used the last means available to her.  As a society we stink at handling troubled kids!

She should have bought the kid more drugs and let him overdosed.  It's a clean break

what a waste people are becoming

The parents shouldn't have dumped a 17 year old on the 75 year old grandma!!!

She should have shot the parents. Someone still should. Pawn em off on the grandparents. That's so easy. My kids won't pull that on me. They know I love them but I'll kick their #$%$ if they try that. Your children are your responsibility! I tell them jokingly,  "I did my time. Anything left  here that start smelling up the place goes in the trash or the garbage disposle."

"Sabbota also played a 911 recording for the jury, a call that Layne made to police two months before Hoffman was killed. Sounding desperate and anguished, she said she needed help because her grandson wanted to run away from her home." Sounds like maybe he did want to go to that bonfire, and grandma wanted to stop him from going, so she killed him.....

another law-abiding citizens gun nuts have to have access guns.self defense maybe shoot once or twice i can see but if  she shot him ten times thats kinda overkill isnt it? no matter your age you know right from wrong  you feel threatend i can see shooting to where he cant leave til cops show but dang  ten times that is murder.

damn.....................

I only hope she spends her last days rotting in prison.

I certainly have to question why 10 shots were fired over 6 minutes here...if he was on the phone with the 911 dispatcher pleading for help I would have to assume he's down and no longer poses a threat (if there was one in the first place).  And what's with the parents here?  He was their responsibility to deal with...why are they off in a different state?  I wouldn't want to be a juror in this case, that's for sure.

She should have invited Jody Arias over for cookies, while her grandson was home.

I do not buy her story, convict her, she is counting on getting off due to her age, not, send her to prison for the rest of her life.She did not say I had been hit or injured until the trial, police never saw any injuries on her, she is guilty...but bet she gets off, maybe. I sur hope not.

Gosh.  If only Jon Hoffman had been properly armed and trained in the use of firearms he might have been able to defend himself against these violent and dangerous elderly criminals.

Why did she shoot him 6 times? If he was on the phone with 911 and no longer a threat then how is it self defense? The first shot... maybe...If they can prove it. But not all 6.

she got the self defense idea from Jodi Arias?

Granny had a senior moment and was apparently scared. Send the lady home to enjoy the remaining years of her life.I said on here yesterday she would be guilty and a whole slew of you slobs said no. Fry the raisin.

where are the parents of this young man? they should  have been raising their on child instead of grandma!!!.she raised her own children!!!

The little punk and his friends were probably terrorizing the woman and she probably felt like he was going to knock her off! He was out on parole and bring strangers over and didn't give two $#$#@s about his grandmother, just where his next fix was coming from. He got what he deserved!

Unbelievable, that fact that some of you actually seem to be supporting, and making excuses  for  this murderer. If this were a case in which a man shot  a 17 year old girl 6 times not only would he be publicly called a monster, this case would be all over every news outlet and there would be at least 15 articles covering it on yahoo alone. Violence against anybody is never okay, and she should fry for it.

ALL firearms should be collected and banned!

"The question for jurors: Should she be held criminally responsible for Hoffman's death and, if so, how?" WOW JUSTICE HAS BECOME A FARCE FOR VICTIMS..IT IS SO SHAMEFUL

I bet the punk had on a black hoodie on with a pocket full of Skittles.  Sure he was going to a bonfire that night. mmhuh..He probably planned to use granny as the kindling. I would her give time served and take her out to dinner. Some people here don't seem to know what ELDERLY ABUSE IS. Oh, that's right, liberals like the kick the h*ll out of thier folks and call it (Obama) healthcare.

Fry the old bag!

verbal sbuse is just as scary as physical. here is a healthy teen threatining a 74 yr old.she isn't fast moving or strong.let the threats continue over a period of time and a real fear for life arises.once she started to shoot,she wouldn't stop until she felt the threat was gone.fear is a strong feeling to over come.

This is a sad case, I cannot imagine the hell she went through in order to come to the point of killing him. I definitely believe he assaulted her though, and it wasn't the first time.We all know drugs is the cause of this, for those of you pointing a finger Have you got a druggie in your family?  If not you have no clue how bad they want their dope nor how far they will go to get it.  If she is guilty then so should our government be also, they do nothing to fight drug traffic, (except give them guns to protect their merchandise!)  Yeah where are the parents?  druggies too??

Well, she got him before he got her.......like that recent one did when his grandparents picked him up from prison, took him to a parole officer visit, threw a dinner party to welcome him home, and what did he do?      He strangled them to death later that same day he'd been released from prison, and stole their car, tried to amass guns to go on a shooting spree and kill "persons in authority", whoever they were, and then checked into a hotel in Oregon and pretended he was trying to kill himself.

Young people take advantage of elderly people all of the time and it looks like this woman tragically was pushed to her limit.......Wish for her and him that it had not happened.

It is a little hard to believe that the lady in the picture would shoot and kill her grandson in cold blood unless she felt she absolutely had to do it.

Midwestern White Trash idiot. Can't handle her lost looks and takes it out on someone younger. I hope the electric chair fries off her ugly wig.

She is guilty. He was shot, pleading for his life, and yet she continued to shoot him, that is no longer self defense, that's plain outright murder. She could of held him at gunpoint until authorities arrived, but she kept shooting.

Murder is too strong a charge, but self defense might get you one or two bullets but not 10 and chasing him down.

Granny whipped his (_*_)!!

Dirt-bag grandson got what he had coming, Detroit is a toilet

Last time I checked you can't just blast someone to death because your paranoid.  Send his #$%$ back home or something.  She's crazyAh, let her go. If he had drugs in his system, then it's self defense.

Not gulty!

"master race"

Raising a teenager can be very hard. and getting away with murdering one shouldn't beeasy.If every parent, grandparent,  teacher, bus driver shot a teen that was giving them a hard time, they would ALL be dead

I applaud you grandma, you got rid of a piece of dog S**T !!!!

What did he do, leave the toilet seat up one time too often?

the kid deserved to die. Grandma was scared shetless and defended herself because it was going to be him or her. His parents didn't want him. Too busy. Mom was looking for an apartment and Dad- well he was creating a law firm called ADAM- which seeks to give divorced dad's the right not to ever pay any child support. Sonny boy was in his way. So they threw him with grandma- a kid who loved K2 and...... violence.  .

I had a crazy grandmother so I don't look at this lady and think she's innocent simply because she's elderly. The fact is, scared or not, she could have called the cops before shooting him repeatedly while he begged for mercy. I believe in defending yourself, but I'm sick of self defense being used to rationalize cold blooded murder. Personally (from the little I know about this case), I believe she's guilty--and not just for "involuntary" manslaughter.

She murdered him.  Period.

This is precisely why we need to install handrails on electric chairs.He would of been better off robbing a store.  But, you don't rob your family or others.  He got what he deserved.  It was either him or her, she chose herself.  He would just come back again and it would be worse.

Jeeeez   10 times over 6 minutes???   And after shot 5 she still felt endangered??   Convict her.

Grandson: "Grandma, can I have some chocolate chip cookies?"  Grandma: "Eat lead!"

Just another Druggie getting his due !! All Potheads / Drug addicts Should be PUT Down ,they are the scourge of this Planet !! Give Grannie a Metal &amp; Let her go Home !!

We need more of these grandmothers and parents stand up to these thugs and put them in thier place , in the morgue .

Even if he attacked her first or whatever you don't go shooting your grandson what the hell is wrong with people!!!

I love how everyone is so quick to judge off of so little information. I personally think she has crazy written all over her face, but I will not presume to know enough to make such harsh judgement on either side.

We'll dang if thats her excuse, I would of shot and killed both my kids a long time ago . Still at the age of 27 and 28 they are driving me crazy asking me for money all the time , I just give them the money so they will shut up..and leaveeeeeeeeeee..hehehe

10 shots may not be overkill folks, in high stress situations people often unload entire firarms at the threat and do not realize it.  A state trooper who was my firarms instructor when invovled in a shooting when questioned about it actually thought he had fired 3-4 times when in reality he had fired 12-13 almost emptying his gun magazine.  Now if she had a revovler and stopped to reload we may have a different story just saying the number of shots fired shows somone very little.

It seems strange that she shot him once, and then continued to keep shooting him. She should at least be found guilty of manslaughter.Sharp shooting granny!

You go grandma...I'm on your side...

You can read the court report on this case, and what Yahoo is not telling you is that this kid was tormenting this woman for years, everybody has a breaking point.

Without knowing the whole story it sounds to me that this punk terrorized his grandmother in her own home striking her at least once  that one time but probably had done it in the past. He sounds to me that he was no good being on parole and worried for himself about going to jail. Unlike a battered wife or girlfriend that has the chance to leave this grandmother had enough of living in fear in her own home and did society a great favor. At least he knew what she had been going through with his behavior fearing for her life before he was shot.

It looks like mean and crazy runs in the family. In this case the apple did not fall too far from the tree.

You guys backing the grandmother, have you thought about the fact that the kid was trying to leave her home.  She even called 911 to stop him from leaving.  That doesn't sound like someone who is tired of the kid's shenanigans.  She calls the authorities to prevent him from leaving, and we are suppose to think she was so scared of his actions that she shot him 6 times.  And he's screaming with 911 for help while this old witch is still haunting him.  And synthetic marijuana does not make him a drug addict.  Read the article people and focus on the facts.  There is no excuse for what she did.  Sounds like the kid was tire of her meanness, that's why he tried to leave.  Let's face it, evil people are still evil when they are old.  How are you afraid of someone on the phone crying out for help and you are firing off 10 rounds?  This mean old witch lost it and assassinated this kid.  Also no evidence of abuse whatsoever.  What do you expect her to say in court.  I got mad and killed him?  Sure she is going to make it self-defense.  But as a lawyer I can tell you, when you are threatened, and the person threatens you retreats, and you become the aggressor, self-defense no longer works.  Lock her up!!!!!

I think she was afraid of him. I also think her fear made her temporarily insane.  She obviously loved her grandson but I think he broke the last straw for her.  You never know what goes on behind closed doors.  Sad

Both sides are at fault. The teenager obviously has aggravated her, but the grandmother also didn't stop shooting either.

She had enough of him and might be threatened before.??

No big deal, she'll only serve 10 years - and then be dead of natural causes.Granma if you lived all them 74 years with out a criminal record, or violence something enraged you, hope all works out a double tragedy!

No one deserves to die in this fashion.There was other ways to rid her home of her grandson.Where are the gun nuts now?This is very sad to say the least.

She murdered her own grandson.  Give her life in prison....which will be less than a year for her to suffer.

Poor old girl. I live in this community  the kid was a well known druggie and bully he most likly got what he deserved. How can anyone beat on an old lady much less your own grandma?  Im thinking the little creep is rotting in hell as he should be. He was old enough to know better!  If anyone was to beat on me and bully me the way this little nut job did his granny you bet I would put at least 10 caps in his filthy little brain!

Crazie Be-Itch !

Sorry, folks...no sympathy from me, she ran and got the gun, what was her mental state, why couldn't she call 911 and let the law take care of her grandson..... show some wisdom. She is quilty of her actions, no excuse..........

I don't understand how she though that many shots were necessary--of course people who are scared don't always think rationally. This is why people with guns scare me (and no I am not against the right to bear arms). I feel so horrible for her and her grandson. I also wonder why the hell he wasn't with his parents. At 70 years of age this woman should not have had to deal with a troubled teenager.

Sorry, if she shot him once in 'self defense' that might flly.  But to continue shooting at him 10 TIMES!!!?!  Did she have to reload?  This is something else.  She needs to serve time.

self defense is shooting someone to keep them from hurting you 6 times over a 10 minute span is not self defense regardless of age sex race etc.

everyone has a breaking point..I can understand her Fear, but shooting a person That many times tells me She is unstable......once would have been enough,and then call 911....There is no excuse for shooting someone 10 times , that was overkill, Lock Granny up, and throw away the Key.

Self-defense is two shots...ten shots is plain hatred!

And they say " Dont Mess with Texas ". Looks like to me its Dont Mess with Granny

If I had be shot once I would have run for my life!! Why stay in the same place, get on the phone, and get shot 10 times over a 6 minute period. I'm not fast, but I think I could have been 300 yards away in one minute if my life depended on it.She was one #$%$ off old lady. Talk about ornery!

if you click on the video about it..they have other 911 calls from the grandma you can tell by the reaction of the operators that she must call like alll the time..and she sounds battier than a shithouse rat. i

of course she should be held criminally responsible! poor boy.....

the    grandmouther  should  go  to  prison

The Myans made her do this.  Shalom

A call to mom and or dad and saying, hey i cant handle your kid, come and get him. problem solved.

If Obama had a son, he would look like Jonathon.That poor woman. She doesn't deserve any punishment for being afraid of a druggie. People on drugs should be treated like Zombies, aim for the head...

Once again: To stop a bad grand'ma with a gun. we need a good gand'ma with a gun!!!!

Ok, I think something is missing, where was the weapon located exactly???? .Most people keep their guns in safe places and it just isn't easily reachable.  The woman must have planned this because if he struck her there would have been some evidence or she would have said it since the beginning. Seems like it was well planned, even the whole "I was the scared grandma part" (with age comes wisdom). I say lock her up if this was anyone else they would. Just because she's old that doesn't mean  she isn't a bad person.

because people are old its easy to take them to the cleaners , young folks are uncaring unkind and criminal not all but still it happens more than you know

A lot of crazy national stories this year, but this might take the cake.

Like anyone else she should be put in prison for the rest of her life., didnt give him a chance at all, he was only 17....such a shame a grandmother would act like that to her own grandson....RIP

LOCK HER UP !

She needs to tell them  if he  raped her.  Most  probably  what happened.Well he will never  hurt anyone again.

If she's acquitted, Obama will name her to be his new "Weapons Czar" !!!

If she said it was self defense then that's good enough for me!She did a favor to humanity by getting rid of a trouble maker drugged brat, regardless of what the prosecutor and the biased media try to make appear otherwise.

SAd another one dumped on Grandma she probably was in fear for her life but you know to unload all them bullets she was either scard or wanted to make sure she finished probably what he started. 95% of teenagers I see have absolutely no respect for anyone. GOD bless the other5% that probably had a loving upbringing most times its the parents fault what turns out but not always!

She should have unloaded to gun into his head.

This is what I don't understand why almost everyone is for the grandmother people this lady shot the boy once the kid called 911 meaning he needed help she killed him in a resentful spirit come on

"she said she needed help because her grandson wanted to run away from her home."...maybe because his grandmother was a crazy gun toting murderer?

Why are they even in court on this...Was it her home and did she feel threatened? If it was the case this shouldn't even be in court...

I am positive that she did this tragically act out of FEAR!

Way to go grandma. I wouldn't convict you.

I believe her story

Sick and tired of this "Little old lady" defense.  If she was going to shoot, could have just shot him in the leg or arm ONCE, not 6-10 times.  Everyone yells about age and racial profiling, unless of course it could benefit you.  Lock her up.If he is on the phone witg 911 then self defenses goes out the window. Once they stop bring a threat then u can not keep firing. 6 times would have done that so its a lie and she killed him in cold blood.

......just a late, late, late term abortion!   Heck, ain't that her 'right' or something?

They keep calling him a child hes no child he knew what he was doing when he was taking money from her. The prosecuter should lose his job.if it would had been him being abused by his grandson i bet he would have done the same thing what is wronge nwith the justice system when they even take a case like this to trail.

Self-defense and she shot him 10 times?! 10! That is cold-blooded murder, he called 911 and was begging for his life and she continued to shoot? In no way is that self-defense. In fact, that shouldn't even cross a doting grandmother's mind. There were so many more options than this! I hate that she's probably going to get off just because she's elderly. This is sickening

haha

he was on the phone with the police when she shot him again,are you kidding me ,i hope she rots in prison

She may have been calm and collected when she finally shot the demon, but the demon needed to be shot... he likely put her through hell and back over the years and she just had enough!  She did the right thing by preventing this #$%$ from damaging more people over the years... waster.. wasted... no waste at all...

To many CAINS in this world.My grands are out of control that why i moved 5 states away.

i have no remorse for junkies, he got what was coming to him, he is dead before he could kill someone who was innocent, she took a life, but probably saved more than a few.

Boo hoo.  Boo, hoo.  "Hey, I only shot him 10 times.  What's the big deal?"Old peolple always think they can get away with things.. 10 times shotgun I know for a fact she threaten him before and came threw with her promises.... RIP

Granny was found guilty and the women's prison in the UP is not a nice place to reside.  Good luck Granny!

Id say grandma prob got beat up one to many time in the future and this time when teenage kid went off and started threatening her shed had enough and pulled her gun.  Fired a shot, and im assuming its a 22 since it took 10 shots.  Would be interesting to here what was said on the phone for 6 minute.   Folks can snap under stress wonder if grandma even knew she hit the kid and if he was still screaming threats at her.  I tend to think that it may be self defense as yahoo slant all articles toward a liberal perspective and even this article leaves me thinking it might be a possibility.

Picture her as an asian, indian, korean or black.  Would you change your mind about her?

The boy must of been a punk!  Free the woman...she stopped the spread of the bad DNA.

One shot is self defense, 10 shots, no matter how scared you are,is murder.

For the wages of Sin is Death.....the boy just got paid!

I believe that temporary insanity applies here. I believe the Grandma has been pushed again and again and again until she can't take it anymore and gone insane. How do you feel if you're abused again and again and again until you decide " NO MORE"? Only that is abused would understand this feeling and I believe the grandma is pushed to the brink of insanity by her grandson and I believe the grandson just had it coming.

Most likely she killed before.  ATHALIAH!

He was troubled to begin with; his parents just dumped him with grandma. Charge the parents and not grandma.My teenaged son knows better than to lift his hand to his GM, he would pull back a stub!!!!!My ex-wife's nephew murdered his grandmother who had help raise him, he was a drug addict and "butchered" his grandmother. The state burned him.

HANG HER

Hey that bpunk scared the #$%$ out of her ,confusion and fear , I feel its justified by Grandma, these punks now days are like that ,he uused intimidation and scare tactics against an old weak grandmother , thats one potential imate sponging off the tax payers out of the way ,she deserves a Metal

Just hang the old bat !!!

The kid was trying to get away, and call for help, and she kept coming? That's not self-defense by any version I ever heard of.

"Shot him 10 times over 6 minutes"...Did she reload?

Something was going on, we will never know what truly happened b/c we were not there. I havew never heard or known a grandmother to hurt their grandchild. Usually, grandmothers will allow grandchildren to do whatever they want to do. Something scared this grandmother. She will have to live with this for the rest of her life. How do grandma's child feel about her killing their child. Why didn't he go to Arizona with his parents?

Nice shooting Nana.Six out of Ten hit there target.

I believed you Grandma!

i hope she gets off its no telling what she went thru w him. sorry hes gone but this lady should not have had to deal w him in the first place. his sorry a%%%%$ parents should be ashamed they knew he was a problem child and sent him to grandma. FREE GRANDMAI doubt she will be acquitted, Firing the shot while he was calling 911 rather than retreating to a safe distance makes it appear to be more than self defense. Of course, none of us were there so it will be decided by the evidence and the jury. I don't believe the grandson was an innocent victim either..

Of course don't know all the in's and out's of the case but have had first hand experience with a young person who is addicted and dangerous - believe she lived in a huge state of upset and fear and just determined to end it the only way she could think of.

Case in point: Don’t #$%$-off Granma!

I don't dought that he was taking advantage of her and the sitution,just yelling and screaming at old people causes fear! You can bet he was taking over the show!!!!

It became murder when she continued firing on him with him on the phone to 911 begging for help.

I'd plank her.

My grandmother would hit us with her wood spoon or pop us in the mouth with those gigantic rings on her left hand. That always shut us up.

Grandma did not get run over by reindeer...we are eating venison tonight!!

I am curious what the parents have to say....

Come on grandma !  if a teenager get killed every time because bad behavior where that going to lead us? By the way was the final shot for ?Let gramma go free!  Sounds like the end result of this case was the only way this kid was going to stop being a threat!

bad granny going to get you

I might have to re-think this gun issue.

wow glad my grandma is 93 and never handled guns,,

She killed him that’s a fact,  but what blame does the parents have in this.There laying in the sun in AZ., While Grandma can’t get the kid to shovel the snow.She’s worried about the financial security/and stability of her life going down the drain,and they don’t have to put up with a  rebellious teenager while playing golf. Did they knowof the trouble going on?  I  just can’t  picture a Grandma going berserk over night after she took the kid into began with.  There is to much missing in this story.   Sentence to be determined.

10 minutes is a long time, shooting him 6 times is way too many...

A little bit of overkill on the whole double-tap rule. Damn...

no one can judge no one.because everyone is beening judge this minute.

Growing up with an old woman is hard..Especially for a male... It's like a worried babysitter that doesn't help you grow, but rather treats you like a child your whole life as they personally descend into madness. There were times that I wanted nothing more to get away. As far away as I could.

I understand her fear but shoot and injure and leave.They had better convict. she absolutely does not qualify for self-defense under the statute. If you pursue someone, you aren't in fear for your life. The kid was on the pleading for his life, for crying out loud. This woman is a stone cold murderer and deserves life - what little she has left.

this is what drugs do, it kills, murders, and slaughters peoples lives, when are people going to wake up, there is more to life than needing to so called "feel good", in time the feel good goes away entirely and prison or death........no good!

Guilty! Fry the old raisin.

With all these young bassturds killing and abusing their parents, I'll side with Granny on this one!

Not knowing all of the facts, the question still remains as to why she did not grab a phone and lock herself into an adjacent room to call 911.  Or why she felt the need to shoot this young man at point blank range 10 times.  Too much is left to the imagination as to alternatives she had available to her.  Emergency situations are not treated the same from person to person, but fear can be quelled without taking a life - but by rather impairing a suspect until help arrives.  If this young man meant to take his grandmother's life and took substantial steps in the direction of committing murder and robbery, that is one matter, but if he merely threatened and did not intend to take her life, she is guilty of murder in the 2nd degree where she meant to impair, without deliberating, but took further, unnecessary steps to end his  life.

as far as how many shots?  someone comes to take my life or my family and i have a weapon. . . i`ll guaranty there wont be enough left for the lord to save !   idiots who say you should just do enough to stop an attack?  dead 40 times over should be about right !  laws dont stop criminals and bad folks but overkill works everytime

Grandma from HELL meets grandson from HELL...Deadly encounter.

The solution is obvious, less gun control. And why is the 911 operator sticking their government nose in our business. Liberty!   Sincerely, idiot NRA member

Here we go again no parental guidance - they just leave it up to the grandmother to take care of these kids.  Being in her 70's and being afraid with all the druggies he was bringing to her home I think she did the right thing.  I would be afraid also.  He could have killed her during the night and taken whatever money she had.

Innocent ! Now go bake pecan pie.Bond,Granny Bond

I say hang her old saggy. #$%$. she shot a minor no excuse  good enough to shoot a kid 6 times .hang her #$%$ !!!7

OMG, she's white!!  What is this world coming too.  I should have known because he was a bit dramatic during the ordeal.

Good for Grandma!!! I bet that little ba#tard will never hit another Grandma again. I hope they don't convict her. Grandma was right for what she did.

with the youth the way they are today, let that woman go and give her a medal! }:- o

Man.. US grandma-former Hippie #$%$.  HER FORMER FREAKISH GHOSTS ARE CATCHING UP TO HER!!!!!

All I got from my grandma was a peppermint. Didn't really know how lucky I was back then!

Sad to say it but it sounds like she saved the tax payers some future dollars.

See Granny, you should have used a 1911, double tap and you wouldn't be on trial.

that old #$%$ should be shot 10 times like she shot him ten times. eye for an eye #$%$Grandma should be put to death, period. She sounded angry more than fear. A loving grandma wouldn't shoot, escpecially keep shooting for 10 times, even hunting him down when he got on the phone asking for help.

Meanwhile, if this was a man, he'd be convicted already.

One shot is self defense 9 more is pure murder I hope you enjoy dieing in a prison old bag of lying bones cause that is exactly where your going. I would convict you in 1min based off your own statements fear is not chasing some one around with a gun and shooting them 10 times nor is it self defense You hired an idiot lawyer too

10 rounds-fired what the hell was she doing with a gun  souns like she watches to much tv,she.s seenaile and needs too be put away,like yesterday,,

fry that bitch

Here in Wisconsin it is apparently a mothers Right to get her child high, according to the State appointed Childs Attorney Debra Fohr, the presiding Judge in the case, Fredrick C. Rosa was informed about it and did not deny it.  I have contacted the Congressmen and women and still no denial.  I guess the mothers of Wisconsin have a new "Right".

NOT GUILTY............. Sorry teens, little tyrants on drugs molesting the old for money...

don't let her sob face and old age fool you.

Ehhh, I say lock her up, she could've ran outside and started screaming, at least call someone younger than her to deal with the situation, he was just a kid.

Why didn't she call 911 and report him instead of loading a gun and shooting her grandson multiple times. Now she has to live with the fact that she took her own flesh and bloods life.She should receive an award....you just don't hit women period...much less a elderly woman

fear is not always in the moment.it can build up over a period of time i don't imagine her life was a picnic before this one incident that went to the extreme

The 2nd Amendment strikes again, &amp; again, &amp; again, &amp; again, &amp; again, &amp; again! Who's next?

Thug grandma:)

She could have quoted the bible and say, "Acts 2: 38"..and then when he runs..the police asks why he ran..and he will say, "She said she has an ax and two .38's "...hahaha..ok ok..that was a bad joke!..;-D

At least she isnt dancing around on her hands!

It is just sad and tragic.

to yahoo commenters being left  with grandma because you want to finish senior year because you got accepted into a university is a drug using thug move only absent parents would condone.

she needs to be fried

oh and to "will", YOU ARE A COMPLETE IDIOT. JUST SAYIN'"Oakland County Judge Denise Langford Morris told jurors that acquittal based on self-defense could be appropriate if Layne "honestly and reasonably believed" that her life was in danger — even if she was wrong."Even if she were honestly and reasonably wrong about being in danger? So, would "Oops!" be an appropriate plea by granny?

Metzger, sister of Hoffman’s father, said the teen had just been accepted to Eastern Michigan University after convincing his parents to let him stay in Michigan to finish his senior year after they moved to Arizona.

did you hear the tape? put her in prison for life; thatl be about 2 years.and as far as the gun? s#%@ happens.

The parents should be locked up for putting her in that position to begin with.Not Guilty

let me get this straight he called 911 in front of her she knows that the call is being recorded and she still shots...GRANDMA GUILTY AS HELL.....her age don't mean #$%$.....

6 shots over 10 minutes ?She must have had one of those damned Obama Magazines !

theirs a lot of crazy kids out there they kill their parents for  pleasure if they don't get money for weeds and drug they don't care kill their own relatives the lady maybe shes panic when she start to  shoot her grandson for self defense

My grandmother was a mean ol' #$%$ back when I was a kid in the 60's. She used to beat my #$%$ with a yardstick. Yet she babysat my cousins and treated them totally different. Guess their mother was her favorite child!

The family thinks it was murder but Yahoo commenters must know better.

Throw the book at this witch. She needs to get the Death Penalty for cold blooded murder!!!!!!!!!!look up a pic of jonathan hoffman. he looked no more than 115 lbs. and was smaller than her.

As his family prepares to bury the fun-loving, friendly boy who could build a computer from scratch, they are still in shock, said his aunt, Judy Metzger, 52, of Farmington Hills.“He was murdered in cold blood — he was executed,” she told the Free Press from her home Monday afternoon. “It’s senseless.”

“Obviously if they did, he wouldn’t be in that environment,” Metzger said. “We obviously don’t know what (prompted) this woman, who purchased the gun 30 days ahead of time — a shoot-to-kill weapon. Obviously, the issue lies with her mental facilities. He was just a kid being a kid. Applying and getting summer jobs. He was just getting ready to go to the movies. Of course we don’t understand.”

Not Guilty!Why was the grandmother taking care of the grandson?Because the parents like most in this country are probably losers!I have seen this so many times,these kids are abusive and a threat to the grandparents that take care of them,usually not by choice!!

Wasn't it recently in the news that some people using that synthetic marijuana turn into zombie like creatures on octane, like that guy in Florida that was naked and chewed off the face of another guy? Maybe this was what was happening and that's why it took 10 shots (even though she missed 4 times) to take him down. Because I've never heard of a teenager who was supposively trying to flee, that couldn't out run a grandmother.

Wow, when did Susan Sarandon get so old!?!

Sorry, shot 10 times in self defense? Don't buy it

granny's got a gun...

You go granny. The parents should be going to jail.

at least she kept her shots within the proposed magazine capacity.He stole her drug stash what do you expect is going to happen if you steal grandma's drugs. Get'em grandma!

I do believe he was a troubled youth which lead her to her breaking point. She should of seeked HELP in removing him from her home, bc obviously he was becomming harder to handle. I believe something did escalate between the two which ended badly. I think it just became way to much for her and it was like an out of body experience which lead her to keep shooting him. I'm sure she feels remorse. She obviously LOVED him, bc she took him into her HOME when she did not have to; she is the grandma not the PARENT.  A very sad situation. I feel bad for her it must seem like a nightmare, but she shot this young man six times; she gunned him down. Some type of JUSTICE should be enforced.

The Grandma must be a Naiomi Wolfe adherent - death to the male population. Fry her scrawny #$%$.

There is so much that we don't know.  One thing for sure, it would be a terrible amount of stress to pile on a 74 year old grandma; especially if he was using drugs and running with the wrong crowd.  I ache for her and am saddened that she was put in this situation.  I am a counselor for seniors.  I help them with their medicare questions.  These folks (I'm 65) are facing a lot of fear.  The golden years, for a lot of our older folks, aren't very pleasant years.  Some would be able to deal with this better than others.  It is sad to say the least.

She did what she thought was the right thing.

Grandma being in fear shot to protect herself, let her go!! The grandchild is already dead haven't they suffered enough?

Typical liberal parents putting their problems on their own parents.  Calling 911 because he was going to run away?  Porfavor, she should have let the fool.  I think she was/is nuts.  He sounded normal to me.

shooting an unarmed person to death, was even murder in the wild west.

Guess he didnt know he finally pushed her to the end of her rope.after the first few shots hit the kid, I am pretty sure she was no longer in fear of her life.

She murdered him.  She never said anything about abuse of any kind until long after she was arrested.  He was on the phone with 911 calling for help and she walks up to him puts a few more bullets in him.  She is a cold blooded murderer.

It's ALL Obama's fault.

She did the world a favor !

All I can say is if one of my children or grandchildren smacked me, that there is no way I would be able to shoot them.I may call police to get him out but certainly not shoot them.This is just my opinion.

children these days refuse to listen to grown-ups,they follow all sorts of gangs,they just want to be cool ,when they mess up their life ,there love ones feel the pain because there is'nt anything the could do but stand by and watch there children life go down the drain. parents or guardians need to start being there children best friend instead of just letting them lose to the curel world

Go a Grandma shoot that little #$%$ bag. Zero tolerance for elderly abuse. He was obviously a drug addict and #$%$ bag one less on earth thank you Grandma.

returning Evil  with Evil to no one ! Maybe if taught this wouldn't have happen ?

Her responses to police when they came to the house are those of someone is shock!!!!

Frustrated with someone's behavior. Shot the SOB. It's the American way.Sounds like she did society a favor.

if he struck his grandmother then he deserved to be shot 10 times

Guilty! Fry the old bag.

I don't believe the implication that synthetic marijuana made him "drug crazed"

Hmmm!  An argument over "HER" money with her "CRIMINAL" grandson and then he THREATENS her and HITS his 70 year old grand mother!  He, as a grand child should have respect and honor for his grand mother, instead he wants her money he has already had run-ins with the law, he's on probation, he argues with her, he hits her.  He sounded like a real pain in the neck.  And if we waited a little longer he would be out robbing people at gun point.  My wife was robbed at gun point by one of these pain in the neck hoodlums who threatened her life for a few stinking dollars! They said "If you do as we say then you will go home tonight."  If you are a pain in the neck, take notice, Nobody owes you anything.  If you get help be thankful for it.  Don't make stupid demands of others.  Man up and take care of yourself.

Ah life. Isn't it beautiful. I guess Jesus was absent that day. God will never give anyone more than they can handle and all of that...

Gun toting granmaw shoots grandson 10 times (3 times in the back) and claims self-defense.  The only dweebs that would believe this story are the gun-nuts and 2nd amendment folks who think the solution to everything is to blow it away.  Really cool granny.

I'd give her six weeks or life, which ever comes first.

Not guilty should be the verdict here.  Just my opinion.

AQUIT THE WOMAN---to start with the parents should have been doing something about this drugged-up troublemaker, not leading their perfect life elsewhere while grandma had to fight him off..Shame on these deadhead parents.How is it self-defense when he is on the phone with 911 asking for help.  He is the only one being threatened there.  Self-defense goes out the window when the offender retreats and you become the pursuer.  If she was so afraid of him, why did she call 911 when he wanted to leave her home.  Let him leave and you have no threat.  This is a mean old biddie who hunted down this kid and killed him.  You don't get a pass just because you are old.  Guilty as sin!!!!

What a heartless #$%$! How could u repeatedly shoot your grandson as he begged for his life...This old hoe should rot in jail for the last miserable years she has left!

Shooting her grandson 10 times seems a bit excessive.  What was she using, a .22?  Wish the report had stated what kind of weapon granny used so the gun grabbing idiot zombies could try to get that type firearm banned too.

My mom used the wooden spoon when i was younger, then switched it up to the metal coat hanger later on for maximum whippage. A few shoes were thrown at my head too lol

Well.. In short, young people are losing there #@@^%^$ minds... LEAVE GRANDMA ALONE

a poster grandma for the NRA

another granparent having to take care of a grandchild because the parents are too dam lazy or selfish to take care of the child themselves ... I would say that it was probably unecessary to shoot that many times, but who knows .. maybe she wasn't trying to shoot to kill, but to keep him away .. it doesn't say what caliber gun she used either

Leave Grandma alone ! Save Grandma ! Free Grandma !

She did the wotld a favor by taking this idiot out.His friends came over to smoke dope and tried to hide the smell from her and when she confronted him with what she knew was happening he satarted calling her names,like you senile old b%$#h and she got tired of his abuse.She said he was always treating her like dirt,,never listening to reason.He said he would get even with her for whatever she did to try and mess with his life and his partying.He got mad when she refused to help him get away from the law.Smoked his grass never caring who sees him.A real pot head loser.

She is just evil. Age has nothing to do with this. I know people over 100 that are crystal clear mentally. She just became an executioner and didn't want to be bothered with parenting a child that desperately needed parenting, guidance, patience and love. She is crying wolf. A liar.Well she has called the police once on him and got no where. So at her age she figured that she was on her own from that point on. The 911 call is damaging BUT

grandma did the court's job for them&gt;&gt;&gt;

She finished him off and that's good enough for 1st degree for me.  Don't give me that "she's senile" bull either.

Do the crime serve the time-age can't be a factor. Put her away an throw the key away. She will do well in prison and be someone's grandmother. There is a place for her and it is her time to come to justice.

She is guilty. If your scared &amp; have the gun shoot him in the leg &amp; then run out of the house. He was a teenage boy what teenage boy doesn't try to get their way. You do NOT kill a child!!! Shooting him 6 times was totally uncalled for. Previously she called 911 when he was trying to run away...doesn't sound like a threat that time. Normal teenager....Hello? I say fry her!!!!!!!!!!

Seventy-five and trying to help her 17 year old grandson... on parole for drugs???  Physically unable to control or possibly even reason with the thug.  Sounds like she was pushed to her limit.

This kid was a bad kid so what he isn't a murderer and doesn't have a chance to redeem himself now because his Grandmother shot him to death

Lets see Obama blame this on video games

No doubt her son had gotten mixed up with dark skins and was influenced by them.  The world is better off now

The grief of having to kill your own grandson is punishment enough.  From what I understand about the synthetic marijuana, it's worse than the real stuff and she probably was in fear of her life.  She is the innocent one in this case.pack your cucumber your going to jail.

Hero.

I guess Grandma must just be a Satanist... Or wait.. maybe it's the grandson... or perhaps the parents.  Nope. Just an example of poor parenting gone completely awry.

Parents left this kid, 74 yo grandmother alone and does anyone doubt he has caused her problems in the past? Kids today have no respect...Just like the gov't What was she to do? let hime come back later and kill her..It's sad and she did what she needed to do at the time.

Not too long ago, a store owner was being robbed and shot the robber 6 times. He was convicted of manslaughter, and the tape showed him shooting in defense. The court cried more than 2 bullets was too much, that it was "overkill". He is now serving time in prison. So granny shot Jr. 10 times, while he's on the phone pleading for his life? #$%$ granny, she should spend her final years in a slammer. You don't kill your own blood while they are pleading for their life. That's 1st degree murder. She needs an 8×10 for life.

Oh how sad.  Grandma you should have told the loser parents to step up to the plate so you could go play bingo.   Losers parents...Losers!!!  Let someone else bear your burdens.  Hope you can sleep at night.

Absent parents, but very involved grandparent...at least when parents drop the ball grandma exchanges it for a revolver and demands the respect.  I don't condone the killing but self defense is definitely on the table.  Put your hands on my grandma after she finishes wooping her #$%$ but might consider not shooting you!!

I think Grandma got tired of this guy's bull cr@?.. wether self-defence or not he pretty much had it coming. I would let grandma out.. Thats just my opinion. Nobody has the right to take anybodys life but we dont know what really went on behind doors.. We will probably never know...

Get On Them Young !!And Have The State Mind There own Damn Homes!! We Can Nip All This In The Bud !!! All These Little #$%$ Know Those Word's I'LL CALL DUFUSSS !!! Yea I Did Spell It Right !!!!

She was probably right to be afraid of him, shooting 10 times, the only way to understand that is if you have been in that situation. Had she not shot and killed him, a few months later we would have heard about a case of a 17 yr old killing his grandmother..Wow.  This is a tough one.  I have no doubt that she was scared but I also think she was angry.  Who wouldn't be in her situation?  Shooting 10 times is a lot though.  I think I would lean towards voluntary manslaughter.

She shot him because he wanted to run away.  She's guilty of murder.

She shot and continued to shoot over 6 minutes an unarmed minor probably lying on the floor bleeding to death because she felt threatened.

Hopefully the jury has heard of "nullification by jury" and finds this poor woman not guilty.  This post copyright 2013, JR, may not be copied, stored or re-used.

If the punk kid even sassed off at me I would have blown him away too.

Geez getting killed by your own grandmother?! I say LOCK HER UP. Period. End of discussion. No question about it. HANDS DOWN. She is GOIN TO JAIL.

"... over money that he had demanded from her so he could flee Michigan ..." .She's afraid to be left alone that's why she killed him.

The NRA is soooo proud of her.

Grandma put him out of his missery.Now he can't continue to hurt himself or anyone else.Did she do the right thing? Only God can decide that in the end.

Way to go Grandma.   I think you did the right thing by getting rid of one more drug head!Give the lady a gold star, she got rid of a punk.

Not guilty.

The grandmother should not go free - she committed murder and overkill in doing so. If she was afraid why wasn't SHE the one calling 911??? The troubled teen needed help, apparently long before this tragedy occurred.

Kids can drive you nuts.

old girl had enough...i won't judge her until i've walked a mile in her shoes.

This B**ch needs to be get life, so what if shes old she should have called the cops not         f%ckin shot the kid . GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY  This was murder not self defense, one shot is self defense 6, thats hunting humans !!!

Granny is GUILTY! Could this signal the end of the #$%$ pass"?

THIS IS WHY WE NEED TO ban guns!!!!! And what effing lawyer uses "Tony Soprano" as an example of good comparison?! I'd get my money back from that guy.

Why mug an innocent citizen when Granny can be intimidated and extorted--Great parenting!

Guilty.  You lose your right to self defense when your attacker is pleading for his life on phone with 911 and u still make the conscience decision to keep pulling the trigger.  To top it all off he obviously didn't even assult her enough for her to report so much as a bruise.  That's not enough to support getting a gun, hunting him down in the house and shoot him until he died.She was probably abused by this guy on a daily bases,when he abused her again this is was the straw that broke the camels back,she knew she had end this abuse once and for all,verdict self defense.

Why would she have a gun if its self defense would she have time to hold him down, 74 year old lady wouldn't be walking around with a gun with over 6 bullets in the clip.

Because she is white and old she will get zero time

The kid did nothing but call for help and she murdered him in cold blood.

She is an animal and a killer of a kid. Therefore I have no sympathy even though she is white.

Under the circumstances, (1) was sufficient and (9) more were merciless.

what was she doing with a gun? Protection? Not likely!

Did she shoot him out of fear that he would harm her or that he would leave her all alone?

I hope they fry her

I'll Pay Granny For Some Shootin Lesson's And Give Her A Vacation In Florida !!!This is not something i would want to have to vote on.i am a grandmother and i have been on the other side of this coin.once your children or grandchildren know what you are most terrified of,they know how to use it as a weapon to hurt you or destroy you.

Just as I've been saying on these posts for years, most wo=MEN, killers are GERMANIC, or JEWISH! Just as this murderous wo=MAN, GERMANIC, just as the fe=MALE judge is JEWISH/ GERMAN, even uglier! My prediction, she'll walk! Same with Jodi Arias! Hope I'm wrong!

Kid sounds like an angel

The kid was probably high on spice and out of his head. Heck, I'd be afraid of him too. I'm going to say "Good shooting granny." The kids on parole and doing spice? He never did learn and now he's not a threat to anyone anymore.

she will give the prisoners a new meaning for the the prison saying "fresh meat"!

Unless she's got a record, let her walk.  Real threat does not have to be eminent.

#$%$ - this one needs to go to jail forever...

She deserves 30 day's of vacation time in paradise.

She pursued him to kill him... Send the old bag to the chair.

What is the problem with you people? Last week the mother of twins murdered her babies, now a grandmother savagely execute her grandson. Are you incapable of love, morals,values,  life?So if she was so afraid, why not let him run away?

What a ruthless #$%$, she deserves the chamber.

if they let her go.....then justice in this country is dead..this was murder...planed murder..and her own family...

Weapons: Americans' favorite tools of death, misery, destruction, sorrow, pain, suffering, hate and all the other terrible things associated with their e.vil presence!Yes, I know  you Gun Nuts, they're "Inanimate objects", but just like an Ouija board or a Pentacle, they are symbols of E.vil and invitation for "Sat.ann" to ruin lives!

Grandma should have taken him to FL and use the "stand your ground defense"; seems to be used a lot in FL :(:(:(

And OUR #$%$ government want to let OUR children have this #$%$. Just another reason to throw every liberal out of office!

I believe that kids misbehaving should get a spanking or some type of punishment, but to shoot them, kinda going overboard.... So if they give her the death penalty, she has 20 years appeals so she'll probably die way before then and waste tax payer money... If given the death penalty, the judge should just pull a gun out right there and bam, get it over with...

Druggies are losers.  They get to the point where they'll do anything for the drug, including hit their own grandmother.

OK I won't ask...White People R CRAZY! Was it a deadly game of hide &amp; seek, come out come out wherever you are.... Thou shall not kill (10 times in 6 minutes?!) TEBOW TIME!I'm often imitated....NEVER DUPLICATED!

Lock her up for life!lock he away, she's a murderer. A cold blooded murderer. He was probobly messed up by growing up with this mess of a human being. Just because she's old doesn't mean she gets to hunt down a kid &amp; kill him. I can't believe people are defending this monster

this lady killed her grandson because he was going out that night and she said no thats no excuse and she still blames him and lies about it let her die in prison

Ugly JEW! The fe=MALE judge said, it could be self defense, even if she's wrong? Even if she shot him, 10 times, over the course of 6 six minutes? The fe=MALE judge should be sent to the OVENS!

There is no excuse for her committing murder and she should be found guilty and I hope they attach special circumstance for the death penalty so she'll rot in prison through the appeal process: ten years.

Older woman, scared for her life. You cannot predict how people react to things!!!!!

Convict her of first degree murder, but Casey Anthony goes free.  This grandmother was abused by this fool of a grandson.  His parents need their @#%#$%$ whipped for dropping his drug addicted butt off with this little lady.  Even a dog gets tired.

This is awful! Obama needs to use his executive power to ban the second amendment from America. There's no reason for citizens to own guns, only the military and police should have them. For hunting? Um....it's called Go to the supermarket! For protection? Yeah, we have police for that as well as many various non-lethal means to protect. More people killed their loved ones and commit suicide with their murder machines than actually protect anything.How many more gun tragedies must we endure as a country before we finally say "Enough is ENOUGH!!!" A congresswoman, innocent movie theater patrons, school children and now police?!?!!?! And yet, I've not be reading any stories about that home invasion that was foiled by the brave gun owner. Hmmmm. They have created a strawman argument and presented a scenario that's about as likely to happen as the Earth being invaded by aliens. They love to talk about their guns, probably to compensate for shortcomings in other areas.
