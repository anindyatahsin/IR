Look at the Neilson Ratings, NBC is never in the top 20 shows except for sporting events.

If people were smart they would never watch it......multiple source reading is the only way to find the truth today.

Aw Geez!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Are you serious?!?!?! How can ap come up with this B.S.?!?! Again ap, people understand  abc, cbs and nbc are part of the "libtard media fraternity", but c'mon, do you really expect rational people to believe their collective ratings are dropping because of the "time change"? That's funny!!!!!!!!!!!

No, people are wiseing up to the fact they sold the Iraqi war to the American people with GOP propaganda. Refused to ask questions all for the sake of corporate ads and most important only 6 corporations own 99% of the US media. The "Business Plot" is alive and well.

These stations are part of the Obama Government Media...Americans are sick of their lies and non-stories about important Obama Administration screw-ups...they will soon be replaced by cooking shows

Not enough time in the day or night to wait for TV anchors to parse out the news piece by piece. With the internet and some excellent news sources, TV news is going the way of newspapers...bye bye.
