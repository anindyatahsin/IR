I'm sure central bankers will use a front company/local bank and take it over..

Cyprus banks just made a move to confiscate up to 10% of their customers deposits.  Once the depositors are allowed to access what's left, the banks won't have customers and without customers threre is no bank.  I would hope no one is stupid enough to buy a doomed bank.

The economy of Greece will continue to be in the toilet until the overpriced Euro is dumped and Drachma is reinstated.

The funny thing about this is that the reason cypriot banks are in the mess their in is because of the losses they had to take on Greek debt.Cypress is now broke because they borrowed to much money to Greece. Everyone should remember this the next time a family member asks for a loan.

greece print your own money and pay them back with dracmas and digitized units,  before they take your ancient country

looks like the Greeks would gain valuable consul from Elmo the Geek
