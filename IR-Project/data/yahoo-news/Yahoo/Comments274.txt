Either there are a lot of undiagnosed autistic adults around or autism is happening more often.

I was in 2nd Grade and Nick was my classmate.  I was too young to understand my grade school had at least one autistic student in each class-room.  Nevertheless Nick had problems in social day-to-day interaction, whereupon he isolated himself from everyone.  I realized he had autism.  It was a bit eye-opening to say the least being in 2nd Grade.

The article is misleading. 1 in 50 has Autism Spectrum Disorder, not Autism.

I guess Autism is fashionable.School authorities need to be tested for skulduggery &amp; empty heads. Just follow the money trail...teachers today are A.K.s,union thugs,un-inspiring! !

90% of it caused by parents who were drunk or on drugs during conception.....usc study 2013
