We would have plenty of money if the government would get rid of waste and corruption ( that also means workers that really do not do anything) and be responsible to spending what they only take in. We always need MORE laws and more money but the quality of life goes down....what is the deal?

Big business-equipment tax breaks for equipment bought from China. Citizens nailed coming and going.

It is so nice when you think you bought something and own it. Then the government tells you that you have to pay them for it year after year after year. There is no such thing as ownership. You are only renting it from the government after making a down payment to the person you got it from.

That sounds more like a break in BUSINESS TAX to me.

We have lost control of this beast and need to reign it back in. Your children could budget money better than our greedy, careless officials. They spend as though it were monopoly money instead of real currency to be repaid at interest.

Let's not spend less and try to save money, let's just raise taxes instead.

popular question in Goverment HAVE WE TAXED THAT YET?

Anybody remember the Boston Tea Party?

Big business over citizens should be remember at the ballot box in the next election!
