Having knowledge of hydrostatic pressure ,roughly 2700 psi at 5000 feet on the macondo well, I find it very difficult for ANYONE to determine how much oil was escaping through the leak. This my friends is impossible to determine.The fine to B P will be based on the  amount of barrels and we, The consumers will be the ones ultimately paying these fines.

CYA!! It's so much easier to blame accidents on dead people. JERK!

and everyone seems to really think that this was all BP's fault? Let me see, they lose four workers in 2009 and eleven workers in 2010? and these are "incidents"? what did BP have to do with the "incidents" in 2009? my husband is a former safety professional and in almost every accident, the people at fault were the sub-contractors. does not Transocean fit that description? Just wondering.

let's play the blame game!

They gave there lives, what more do you want? Now I remember why I fired Transocean!!!!!Total F()cktards!!!!!

Oh yes. It couldn't possibly the fault of the #$%$ bag management team or their political posturing to gut regulations and ignore basic science? Not to mention the paying off of elected officials to look the other way while they skirt or ignore measures to protect the environment. LIARS.
