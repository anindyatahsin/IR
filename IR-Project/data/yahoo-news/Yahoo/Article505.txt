Targets of NYPD stop and frisk to testify

NEW YORK (AP) â€” More people are expected to testify that they were wrongly targeted by New York City police as a federal trial examines the department's practice of stopping, questioning and frisking people.
The plaintiffs say they were stopped because of their race.
Police have made more than 5 million stops in the past decade, mostly of black and Hispanic men.
The lawsuit seeks a court-appointed monitor to oversee changes to how the police make stops.
A federal judge will rule on whether the department must make changes.
