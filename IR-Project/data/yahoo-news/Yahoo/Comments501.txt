Sept. 4 is not an option because it's the first night of Rosh Hashanah.   UMMMM, SO WHAT??? NFL plays on Christmas, Thanksgiving...and last time I looked, rosh hashishee was NOT AN AMERICAN HOLIDAY!!!!!

"Sept. 4 is not an option because it's the first night of Rosh Hashanah."But they can play on Christmas Day?  And won't the MLB play games the night of 9/4?

Everyone is so worried about offending a religion, unless its a Christian one. In fact they go out of the way to stop Christian celebrations so it doesn't offend the others.

There are a lot of different options here:1)  Ravens go on the road and the game stays on Thursday.2)  Move the game to Wednesday or Friday night and have the Ravens at home.3)  Have the Ravens play their first game on SNF, then have the 49ers take the opener.Does it really matter?  It's not as if this is an ages old tradition.

Last year, the first day of Rosh Hashana was Sunday, Sept 16.  14 games were played that day.  The NFL plays every Sunday, and also on Chrsitmas Day, the holiest Christian holiday.  Why is this particular Rosh Hashana so special?  Or is it just another snub to Baltimore by a league that doesn't like the city?

They should hold a vote in Baltimore

Why is Goodell trying to expand the playoffs?  Who wants to see an 8-8 (or maybe even an 7-9) team make the playoffs?  It ain't broke, Goodell.  Leave it alone!

Buy Bud a hotdog.

The NFL does not need expanded playoffs.

They need to shorten the season, if anything - the Superbowl should be one week after the NCAA championship game.Good leave the playoffs alone, it's a stupid idea. Please stop trying to destroy the game Goodell, thanks in advance.

Good. The season is way too long anyway. How much more $ do they need?

Take it from somebody who lives in Baltimore....The Ravens welcomed the Orioles with open arms during their playoff run last season.  They invited many of the players to the Ravens games, put them up in a skybox, and made numerous mentions about the O's successful season during the games on the big screens.So obviously, the right thing to do here is for the Orioles to play a doubleheader on Friday or even Saturday, since asking the Orioles to play a Thursday afternoon game after returning from a road trip is a bit much.  But, that is not what the Orioles will do.  They will #$%$ and moan about loss of ticket sales for a single night.  They will either require the Ravens to go on the road, or look for the Ravens to provide them compensation for the loss at the gate.The class exhibited by our Ravens organization has always been in stark contrast to the complete lack of it displayed by the Orioles sh*tbag owner, Peter Angelos.

Goodell is an idiot and an #$%$! The Orioles play 164 games a year. The Ravens play 16 not counting playoffs. By September the Orioles are predicted to be in a playoff race. We don't know about the Ravens. Make the Ravens move!!!!!!!

what the hell he doing? leave this game alone Goodell. i don't know how to get rid of him but he has got to go before he destroys the game we love

Who cares if it is the first night of Rush Limbaugh ... they play football on my New Years Day every year!

Prior to Goodell, the NFL was the only major sports league of the NHL, NBA and MLB to keep the headlines about it's on-field product. Since Goodell became the Commish, more and more of the headlines deal with off-field #$%$. At some point, this is going to start to hurt the league.

I do not care either.   Do not watch football any more.

Wait.....your telling me they wont schedule a game on september 4th...because its a jewish holiday!?....really!?If the NFL would get rid of Roger Goodell, the other issues would resolve themselves!

Play Friday, easy, done..

The NFL has "Jumped the Shark".

If we'd had a 16 team playoff this year, they would have included the 8-8 Steelers and either the 7-9 Dolphins or Chargers. What is the point? You're just beating up more players and diluting the quality for the sake of a few more dollars.

Arena Football league is looking better and better as the NFL goes soft.  By 2014 season it will become such a girl game that females will actually be playing in the NFL

move the freakin game to Wednesday night already.

i miss football.

I have no comment on this and simply don't care.

nfl put up enuff $ and the prob goes away

No more playoff spots. 2 fewer pre-season games. 1 foot in bounds for a catch.He looks like McKayla Maroney!!!

How about Sunday afternoon????LOL!That's when football games should be played.

TheNFL should worry about the level of officiating as these referees have been accountable for a lot of controversial games that officiating should have been good. It leaves the fans wondering where these jerks came from. Seattle should have lost that game at home against the Packers but the refs saw otherwise and Goodell and staff just made up stories to justify their own f.....g blunders.Same with the 4th down throw of Kaepernick to Crabtree in the Super Bowl that ought to have been flagged.THIS IS BUSINESS ANDNOT PERSONAL BEFORE ANY OF YOU NFL OFFICIALS GET HURT BY IRATE FANS...

careful ravens he will submarine your season next year like he did to the saints, most corrupt man not in politics.

not impress :'

They need to shrink the playoffs, there are way too many non-competitive teams involved as it is. Its a waste of time

Sept 4 is not an option? because of church evening is very important to people more than football on Wednesday. God come first, football can wait on Wednesday

Does no one at Yahoo fact check? I checked my calendar and the first night of Rosh Hashanah is September 5 but hey maybe my calendar is wrong...

Have the Ravens play the home game on Sunday night, and have whomever the NFL was planning to have originally on Sunday night (rumor it was Denver-NY Giants) play Thursday.

No need to expand the playoffs. If it aint broke, don't fix it. Words to live by.If they expanded the playoffs some of the teams that would get in would be terrible, it would end looking like the NCAA bowl games.  Oh you got 5 wins?  Congratulations here is a playoff spot.

Damn! The NFL found a way to blame it on the Jews.

screw baseball, it sucks anyway

As a lifelong Orioles fan (I even got married at Camden Yards) I can assure you...I will NEVER attend another Orioles game...EVER....for the rest of my life. The fact that Angelos has even let it get this far w/o a solution is inexcusable.  He has proven time &amp; time again that he is a classless, greedy old man who only cares about his bottom line, not the people in his city that actually CONTRIBUTE to his bottom line. The Ravens have been nothing but accommodating &amp; classy toward his shi%%y franchise, and this is how he repays them?? Angelos makes me sick, and this is the last straw.  Bye-bye Orioles...you just lost another fan.

Yeah,Ravens that's not going to work the traffic into downtown Baltimore is hell without games.Hey guys opps we did it again, The Baltimore Blast won the MISL Championship,yeah!

Roger Goodell is not impressed.

why does this idiot try and change a perfect sport leave it alone keep chaning the rules and changing the schedule we will be watching a basball which is in turn golf

TRANSLATION:  TV Networks decide the schedule, NOT steriod pimp Roger Goodell.

What a bunch of #$%$...... FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

roger goodell is a jew in disguise. disgusting.I guess this earning thing didn't pertain to Tampa Bay when they one the Superbowl and had to open the season in Philly because the eagles had a brand new stadium that the nfl(goodell) wanted to open the season at. what a rip off for all the long suffering Tampa Bay fans all the #$%$ season's we endured and we were robbed of the chance to open the season after winning the superbowl.

MLB - just move your game!  You have a 162 game season for f***s sake!  You guys play every day.  You can't find an off-day to reschedule the game on?  Or just do a double-header on another day?And all this "well... we can't have a game before 5pm because it of this rule and that rule..."  BS!  Your players stand around and scratch themselves for most of your "game."  They can play earlier.  Give me a break!

Baltimore has a baseball team?

This article has a lie contained in it. They said the Ravens 'earned' the privilege by 'beating' the 49ers. Come on bro ! EVERYONE KNOWS by now that the NFL and the refs STOLE that Super Bowl from the Niners. If you don't admit it after all the EVIDENCE, then you are in total and complete DENIAL. Goodell needs to LEAVE immediately. Stop trying to change the game !! Worst NFL commissioner of ALL TIME.

The Ravens could play that game in their mom's backyard, against the local high school team... they will still get throttled, cuz this team was never any good to begin with, and now they just got dismantled...Sometimes karma really does work... this team will probably never win another Super Bowl, seeing as how the lifespan of the NFL is 20 years at the absolute most, and more realistically 10 years... beyond that the world of professional sports is a fossil...

Baseball is for p***ies... who gives a s*** about one single baseball game?  It's not like the Orioles play 162 games a year or anything.  Let the Ravens have it.
