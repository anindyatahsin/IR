Duke payes me good divedends and gets it back when I pay my lightbill.

Being a first time investor does anyone think I should sell off my shares of first energy for a better utility?

bust buy is muslim owned.

Look at AEP now.  Swan dive.  As all utilities.  Why would people take money out of utilities to play in the volital Eueropean market?

I have been with Duke for 10 years-it does not go up or down alot but pays a nice divd every yr (over 5%).  Hard to get that with a CD.  If it ever drops under $19 again-I'm buying.

Love my A.E.P stock....solid company and pays nice dididends EVERY quarter..Been with this company for 17 years

Previous close for AEP on Feb 7 was $39.88. Today they show previous close as $39.41?? Can someone explain the difference?

I need utilities to go up and up too, my stock funds are not fairing too well.I THINK DUK IS PLAYING GAMES NOW, BY BY NOW.

Go all the way up utilities-I need a big Christmas!

Duke lets you sleep at night.  4.8% div ain't all bad.  Some upside as well.
