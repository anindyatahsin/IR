2 charged with threatening girl in Ohio rape case

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) â€” Authorities have arrested two eastern Ohio girls suspected of making social media threats against a West Virginia girl who accused two high school football players of raping her in a case that drew widespread attention.
Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine said the girls arrested Monday posted threatening Facebook and Twitter comments on Sunday, the day the players were convicted in Steubenville (STOO'-behn-vihl). DeWine says the girls are being held in juvenile detention on allegations of aggravated menacing after an investigation by state and local authorities.
DeWine says he hopes the arrests end harassment of the alleged victim.
A judge sentenced the players to at least a year in juvenile prison. A grand jury will look into whether others broke the law by not speaking up after the attack last summer.
