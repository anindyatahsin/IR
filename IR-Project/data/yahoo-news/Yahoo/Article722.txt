Parents: Former Oklahoma QB had pilot's license

TULSA, Okla. (AP) â€” The parents of former Oklahoma quarterback Steve Davis say their son had a pilot's license.
Jim and Patsy Davis of Sallisaw, Okla., said Monday their 60-year-old son was one of two people killed Sunday when a small aircraft smashed into three homes in northern Indiana.
They said Davis, Oklahoma's starting quarterback when it won back-to-back national titles in the 1970s, had a pilot's license and started learning to fly before he attended college.
The St. Joseph County Coroner said 58-year-old Wesley Caves also died in the crash in South Bend, Ind. The Davises say their son and Caves were good friends.
Steve Davis' pastor in Tulsa said earlier Monday that he relished any opportunity he could to get up in the air.
