The FDA should be eliminated for the sake of the American people.

Have to side with manufacturer on this one. I am sorry she was so horribly injured, but suing a generic manufacturer that has changed the drugs formulation and has posted all the appropriate warning isn't justified. The cost benefit of having generics available will go down a lot if the they have to buy insurance against these kind of suits.

One adage I've heard has proven to be quite true and appropriate for this...Nature provides no free lunch. Some people will have adverse reactions to medications so to bar the use of the drug for others that may benefit from it is counterproductive because some would rather have all suffer than risk a few suffering to benefit the many.

lol the drugs they make lol  you really think they care who they kill? people are dumb asz #$%$. All about the money it is.

Just goes to show you how incompetent the FDA is in approving drugs. How does a drug with this kind of major side affect get allowed irregardless of the warning on the label or whether is may affect one person and not the next. I have very little faith in the FDA approval process. Every one needs either to research the drug before getting it or ask the pharmacist what the side affects are prior to having it dispensed.

If the woman had taken the same drug under the patent (brand) name, she would have had the same tragic reactions. Just because the FDA declares a drug "safe" doesn't mean that it's safe for everybody. Most people, the vast majority, can take aspirin, ibuprophen (Motrin, Advil), and dyphenhydramine (Benedryl) -- all available in brand name and generic, all available without prescription, all deemed "safe". Yet I can't take any of them, having had moderate to severe reactions to all of them. The drug she took wasn't safe FOR HER under any name.
