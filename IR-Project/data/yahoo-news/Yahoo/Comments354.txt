Groupon can be resurrected if the model evolves to include more social interactivity.  The main reason FB is the most-visited website is because people want to look at their own face and the pictures of others near to them.  Groupon should allow users to upload a profile picture and pictures of their Groupon-sponsored outings.  If we see more user-input on Groupon, we will want to go there over and over.  It's affirming to one's ego, a kind of anchor that validates one's existence - like gazing in the mirror.  Also, pics and comments on places visited via Groupons will ensure more merchant retention through a feedback loop.  If FB is moving into coupons, why can't Groupon allow social interactivity?  More mirror-gazing opportunity means more time spent on the site, which leads to more sales, and a feedback system, increasing the power of the Groupon subculture.

@yahoo user! You clearly do not understand how linkedin works this is its time of your for its stock to raise plenty of kids fresh from college looking for work go there and so many wealthy buisness pay too dollar to be on the front page so they get the best recruits!

No matter how you slice and dice the analysis of LinkedIn, it is not worth anything like the current stock price.  In fact, 1/5 (one FIFTH) of the current stock price would be generous.Have people completely forgotten the lessons of the last two tech melt-downs?  There is no new magical business model that does not require revenue...
