Tracking worked. About time they started using it again.

Finally. No child left behind was stupid. Thanks to my stupid high school classmates A few other classmates and I were held back from learning more advanced material.

I remember ability grouping.  I also remember my third grade teacher would encourage those of us who were advanced in an area to tutor or help those who were lagging in that area.  It reinforced what I was learning to explain to another student, but it also taught me to help others where I had strength.  I like to think I helped, and I like to think it taught me to recognize that none of us are strong in all areas.  Math was not my strong subject, but I was an advanced reader and speller.  Since I was also an emotionally damaged child, it also helped me to relate to other children without withdrawing into a self-protective shell.  It taught me that I had something to offer and gave me a sense of worth at a time I desperately needed it.

blacks are dumb.  FACT!
