Anyone wanna take a guess why the price of beef is going up?

I hope beef contnues to rise and becomes completely unaffordable.

AS THE IRISH SAY " ARRR GIGGLE ME BEEF"

I don't think they can afford to raise beef prices since Europe, Russia and China just banned U.S. beef imports.

let me guess, cattle are on the brink of extinction?

Come on beef... keep going up!
