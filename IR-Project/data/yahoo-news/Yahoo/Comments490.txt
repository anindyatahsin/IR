I require picture proof or this never happened.

This article is worthless without pics

This article attracts the perverts....hey, that's why I'm here.....pitty there's no photos....

Anyone who bought the pants and just wants to get rid of them - mail them to me!  My wife likes to wear things that she doesn't mind ruining when we get "frisky".

So what's the problem? Didn't we just have a national discussion on gay rights. If they have the right to shower with their birth sex and as a society we don't want unisex bathrooms then why shouldn't we show off the gifts given to your girlfriends, mothers, sisters, and daughters. Seems only right.

I think I finally want to take yoga classes.

I assumed that's why they were popular.

You telling me...I love when the Yoga mamas walk by or come into my location wearing those things...you can see if they got curtains or tucking it in...

Seems like there should be plenty of material since everyone buys them two sizes too small.

It's not the sheerness that's the problem. It's women deliberately wearing them so tight that there underwear, or lack of it, shows.Nothing like camel toe to set your day ! lol !!

Pics would be nice....

I'm sure many guys wish the pants weren't pulled from stores..

But isn't that what almost all women want these days, to strut around naked but not naked?

I would like to see this flawed garment. Ummmm.... for investing purposes

anyone notice the shares went down when they went to fix the problem? It's a mans world baby!!
