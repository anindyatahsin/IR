Expert: Arias suffers from dissociative amnesia

PHOENIX (AP) â€” Testimony in Jodi Arias' murder trial has concluded for the day after a defense expert testified that she suffers from dissociative amnesia.
Psychologist Richard Samuels says this explains why Arias can't remember much from the day she killed her lover.
Arias faces the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder in the June 2008 death of Travis Alexander in his suburban Phoenix home. Authorities say she planned the attack. Arias initially told authorities she had nothing to do with the killing then blamed it on masked intruders. She now says it was self-defense.
Samuels also testified that Arias suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder but acknowledged under cross-examination that he based his diagnosis on a test where Arias lied.
Samuels resumes testimony Tuesday.
