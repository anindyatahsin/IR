Heh Yahoo, you do not need to be showing this. It makes all of the liberal states and Obama look really bad. Tomorrow the White House will be sending out some contradiction to this saying everything is just wonderful and we do not have a problem with the National Debt. Won't be long before Oblamo will be trying to take money out of your savings account due to a national emergency...

I'm no politician but from what i can see there is little difference and I live in Florida. My sister is just 22 and she can't even get hired at McDonalds. I wonder when the states will count the numbers of people that gave up.

And obama says we don't have a problem! Guess the white house is the best place to be otherwise why is obama there?

Highest unemployment states, Democrats in control.  Numbers do not reflect those that have run out of unemployment benefits and still can't find work.  Also doesn't take into consideration those that are under employed.

They wont count the number of the people who gave up looking (a change Obama made) because it would show how socialist policies are a failure everywhere and every time they are tried (look to Europe for proof). USA right now is more like 15% unemployment.

Funny how this ignorant administration lays egg after egg and the wealthy are having a field day living off the hardship of others with the middle class getting smaller and smaller.When this administration turns off the freebies maybe some of these stupid Dems will get a clue.
