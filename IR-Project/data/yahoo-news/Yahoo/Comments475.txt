Twist one up...... I'M game

It's called "Anatabloc."

I take anatabloc and it works.I don't want to go without it after a year of taking it.Works better than anything the doctors have prescribed for arthritis so I better buy a years supply. As everyone knows:If something works and isn't making the big drug companies money (who pay off Washington) there is going to be a concerted effort to remove it by any means.If they cant attack the substance then attack the company by enlisting the aid of our government and financial manipulators like "The Street".It wont put the genie back in the bottle but it might impact the production for a while and keep people who need it from trying it in order to keep the suffering patients on those high price drugs and doctor visits.
