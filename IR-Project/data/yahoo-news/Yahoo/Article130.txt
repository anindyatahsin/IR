Journalists accuse Egypt's Brotherhood of assault

CAIRO (AP) â€” Dozens of journalists are protesting against what they claim were assaults on their colleagues by members of Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood from which President Mohammed Morsi hails.
They protested Sunday outside the Journalists' Syndicate in the Egyptian capital, Cairo. The newly elected head of the syndicate condemned the alleged assault, which occurred Saturday evening outside the Brotherhood's headquarters where journalists were covering a meeting.
The journalists say that after activists sprayed anti-Brotherhood graffiti on the ground outside the headquarters, the Brotherhood guards attacked with sticks and chains.
The Brotherhood said in a statement that guards outside the building were provoked and insulted by the activists and journalists. Many of the group's offices were attacked across the country in December.
