The alternative for abortion.

I blame conservative religion.

"Family, friends and church members, who have rallied to support Lowe, were sobbing after the verdict was read by Judge Dee David Gay." Who is sobbing for those poor little murdered infants? She killed two newborns in cold blood. If that doesn't constitute life in prison, I don't know what does.

Speechless because of the utter tragedy of this. RIP little angels.

Typical southern White behavior.  Why are white people so evil?

She didn't want to have them, and then she decided to kill them. Was this a case of a raging lunatic who doesn't believe in contraception or later on abortion? Her choice was the one everyone agrees is murder!

This is so baffling. Why didn't she drop them off at the nearest firehouse or hospital if she wanted rid of them that badly and that quickly?  She could probably have gotten them to one of those places without her parents knowing if that was her biggest concern. If you can hide that your giving birth a few rooms away, you can sneak a baby into a truck. Most states have safe haven laws (though I dont know about Tenn) and they are meant for just this kind of situation. Drop a newborn off with no questions asked as long as they aren't injured.  This is what makes me think she must have been genuinely nuts, but they didn't mention anything about post partum or other mental issues in the article, other than denial. Just a regular everyday idiot then?  So bizarre.

I effing hate these femnazi American women. It should be illegal for these baby killers to even have kids.
