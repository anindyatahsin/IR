Report: Syrian jets hit targets at Lebanon border

BEIRUT (AP) â€” Lebanon's official news agency says Syrian warplanes have hit targets along Syria's border with Lebanon.
The state-run National News Agency says Syrian jets struck targets on Monday in a remote area near the town of Arsal.
The shelling comes just days after Damascus warned Beirut to stop militants from crossing the border to fight with rebels.
A senior Lebanese official confirmed the fighter jets' activity along the frontier, but says it was not immediately clear if targets inside Lebanese territory were hit. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.
Lebanon has been on edge since the uprising against Syrian President Bashar Assad began in March 2011. Gunmen on opposing sides of Syrian civil war have frequently clashed in Lebanon, raising concerns that fighting could spread.
