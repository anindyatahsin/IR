Why do we need these "Glances". We can see what the stocks are doing and all it does is clog up my news feed with 10 or 12 "Glance" messages. Useless.

AT&amp;T WHY?

Silver may go down further and gold will pop because as the market returns, commodities lose favor. Its a rotational sector thingy.

Time to buy silver  now not gold.

pump and dump, pump and dump. wait till the big boys get here next week

I'm smart enough to figure this out, tell me why they are down.
