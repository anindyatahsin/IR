I would think CHK will still benefit from rising Nat gas prices with 55% not being hedged and much better sales prices for their assets now that Nat gas has clearly seen its bottom and wont be getting to those all time lows again.

Big egos make big mistakes. Complacent boards of directors should pay attention...they are paid to do their due diligence but instead they grab a very big paycheck for doing nothing.

If the shale revolution caused a NG glut and reduced its price, then exportnâ€™ it will cause it to go up? After the first 12-18 months of a new virgin well, they fall into the drilling treadmill where we drill baby drill but get less and less production overall due to the sharp production declines of unconventional wells. What we face if we export LNG is higher consumer energy prices for those coal fired plants that were retired &amp; replaced with natural gas fired plants. If the holy grail for McClendon and Obama is for vehicles to run on CNG/LNG, that too will vie for resources and force us to drill like crazy as we try to fill foreign contracts AND fuel our vehicles. What all this drilling means will be global warming on crack, high consumer energy &amp; vehicle fuel prices, and environmental devastation not to mention health effects from co-existing near high impact industrial activities which devalue our properties and destroy a quiet, peaceful homestead.

It appears, to me, that this analyst s way too negative. If nat gas rises in price then CHK assets will rise in value. The company is embarking on a new era, sans McClendon.
