Ohio.that's the state where every body dies except killers.

There's a lot going on in Ohio lately!

Was this dude crazy too?? BubBYE T.J.!!

Wow ....is he going to be popular in prison . Hope he brings his makeup bag and extra thong undies .

Wake up people.

He will be facing life in prison...........along with Big Wally's provolone.

Oh, he's gonna be a real fave of the big boys once he gets inside and they paint a little makeup on him.  Justice will be served.

Lock this #$%$ H*** up for life !

He "could face life in prison"?

He COULD...? face life in prison...?  COULD...?Life in Prison...???     For Murder?            That means we spend 50,000 a year, for him to stay in the new "Corporate Prisons"    And if you make 15,000 a year, your not in poverty?   I see nothing wrong with letting the guys in jail use this fool for a toilet bowl and then execute him in about a month..  One months worth of male on male rape...   And it dies in peace.             Unlike those he killed...

Hang these idiot's right before Lotto drawing each week and let them #$%$ their pants on national TV.This stupidity would stop!

what the hell is going on with this world when all you read are killings by young people. what is going on?? this is insane. go get a paper route-do something constuctive. this is too much.  TOO much evilness.

When they start handing out the same sentences, to parents or guardians, of these teenagers, you will see a dramatic decline in these crimes.  When I was a teenager, I thought of doing many things, that I never did, because I knew what Mama would do, when she found out.

Could get a life sentence?  What about the life sentence his victims and their families are serving?
