Jurors reach verdict in Mich. grandma's trial

PONTIAC, Mich. (AP) â€” Jurors in suburban Detroit have reached a verdict in the trial of a 75-year-old woman who shot and killed her teenage grandson.
The jury must decide whether to convict Sandra Layne of first-degree murder or a lesser charge, or to acquit her on the basis of self-defense.
Attorneys were notified of a verdict Tuesday afternoon. The Oakland County jury began deliberating the case Monday afternoon.
Prosecutor Paul Walton says there was nothing defensive about Layne's treatment of 17-year-old Jonathan Hoffman. He was shot six times last spring at their home in West Bloomfield Township, even while pleading for help during a 911 call.
Layne's attorney says she feared her grandson and felt overwhelmed by his drug use and choice of friends.
