One big question is: is it too tiring to wait Apple climbing the Mount Everest (1000 dollars), because that is not even doubling the stock price, while many cheap potential stocks would quadruple in the same time frame? Is Apple only for traders any more? Because considering holding Apple, the profit does not seem to be worth the effort and waiting. I mean almost a 6x book value stock, and waitingonly for doubling, it is really NOT WORTH IT!Another question is: will Apple get the contract with China Mobile (the world´s biggest operator with about 660 million subscribers)?Considering US´s issue with Huawei and other Chinese firms, I think Apple won´t get the contract from China Mobile so easily.What do you guys think?And China Mobile has already confirmed Lumia 920 arriving November.Canada and France got their black Lumias 920 yesterday, colors follow in near term.UK: Lumia 920 available November 2 in Black, White, Red &amp; Yellow options. Lumia 820 available in UK November 7.Germany gets Lumias 920 and 820 November 5, followed by Italy, Poland and so onin these two weeks.Finland gets Lumias 920 November 22, pre-orders started yesterday after midnight.Australia gets Lumias 920 and 820 the end of November.Verizon Lumia 822 hits US markets before Thanksgiving.T-Mobile Lumia 810 available November 14, AT&amp;T Lumias 920 and 820 available before that.China Mobile confirmed Lumia 920T arriving November.Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 available in United Arab Emirates by November 15.Asha 308 in stores right now.Lumia 510 available in India and out of stocks right now.Lumia 920 and Lumia 820 will be launched in Russia on 6th of November (both Elop and Ballmer will be on presentation). Official prices are: 24 990 rubles ($793) for 920 and 19 990 rubles ($634) for 820.Morningstar about Nokia:October 30Share price assumption at this moment: 2.40 euro (Nokia share is in Helsinki right now 2.06 euro, in New York 2.56 dollar)Best scenario (if WP8 phones go well): the stock price will go to about 7.70 euro per share)Worst scenario: no bankruptcy, because Nokia would be sold in parts before that.Estimated price for this: intellectual properties over 1 euro per share;other business parts (smartphones, featurephones, NSN) at least over 1.50 euro per share.And NAVTEQ´s price not included (Nokia bought NAVTEQ with 5,7 billion euro). All in all even in this case, Nokia share price would be at least over 2.5 euro. Pretty much like my thoughts and analysis. caleb23

Apple's good, but what about other tech growth areas?  Here's a link to an informative article and it explains exactly why the stocks will climb:http://seekingalpha.com/article/921751-understanding-the-future-of-solar

Apple can keep making ipads, each 1/4 inch smaller, then bigger then smaller again, and the "I'm cool" group will keep buying them.  The stock will continue to go sky high!

An iPad 2 for $399 is a better deal than an Ultrabook for $899.Luckily, some of these companies have provided us with hardware to access advanced software applications to view these statistics more efficiently and in strikingly more depth.

Where's Lenovo?   Bigger than Dell.   Rapidly catching HP

This is a great story.  Too bad an "analyst" does not take credit for it since this story is truthful.

why is this even a story?

Apple.  The new Golden delicious.

Still falling.

Apple is not a computer company like Dell or HP. Its Mac business makes up less than 25% of its revenues. In terms of revenues, iPad is now bigger than Mac. iPhone is 3x the size of Mac. More importantly, iPad and iPhone have bigger margins than Macs.
