Lots of jobs in Minneapolis area for all trades. All our skilled people left to do oil rigs next door. So come here and you'll find all the work you want. Weather can be cold though. But you get used to it I reckon.

I think if americans will wake up and go smaller they will find happiness and good business once again. Smaller is better....

nice share

There should be more than only four.
