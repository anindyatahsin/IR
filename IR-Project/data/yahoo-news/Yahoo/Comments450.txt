John Pike, caught pepper spraying student demonstrators on camera and video and who six months later was fired.from Slatest 8-1-2012:"After Pike was identified as the officer in the video, the hacker group Anonymous posted his home- and cellphone numbers online. Since the incident, heâ€™s reportedly received 17,000 angry emails, 10,000 text messages, and hundreds of letters. He changed his phone number, email address, and has moved several times."
