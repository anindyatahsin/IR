Major Nigeria airline halts flights over strike

LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) â€” A major Nigerian airline says it has suspended its flights after failing to reach an agreement with striking workers.
Simon Tumba, a spokesman for Aero Contractors Co. of Nigeria Ltd., said Saturday the strike, which started Wednesday, has halted flights "temporarily."
Many foreign oil companies patronize Aero Contractors, which operates flights to major domestic destinations and neighboring Ghana. The company's website said it is working to restore flights "as quickly as possible."
Nigeria's aviation industry has faced a series of challenges over the past year.
One of its carriers was grounded last June after a crash that killed more than 160 people. It has been battling to win back flyers' confidence since it resumed operations two months ago. Another carrier collapsed last year amid allegations it hadn't paid staff for months.
