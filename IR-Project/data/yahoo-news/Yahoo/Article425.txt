2 girls charged with threatening Ohio rape victim

COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) â€” Prosecutors in eastern Ohio have filed formal charges against two girls accused of posting online threats against a 16-year-old rape victim.
The two teenage girls are being held without bond in the Jefferson County detention center in Steubenville, as is customary for juveniles.
The girls were charged Tuesday with intimidation of a victim, telecommunications harassment and aggravated menacing.
The 15- and 16-year-old girls would face up to seven years in prison if convicted as adults, but it's likely they would be treated as juveniles. That means they could only be detained up until their 21st birthdays, if convicted.
The girls are accused of sending threatening tweets about the victim Sunday, the same day her attackers were convicted in juvenile court.
