Ohio teen faces sentencing in 3 student murders

CHARDON, Ohio (AP) â€” The teenager who killed three students at a northeast Ohio high school in a shooting rampage just over a year ago could face life in prison at his sentencing.
A judge in the tight-knit courthouse community of Chardon, east of Cleveland, was scheduled to sentence 18-year-old T.J. Lane on Tuesday on his guilty plea to aggravated murder and other charges.
The three students who were wounded and survived and relatives of the slain students were offered the chance to address the judge before the sentencing.
Relatives of the slain students indicated earlier they want Lane to get the maximum sentence.
Lane's guilty plea Feb. 26 came on the eve of the anniversary of the 2012 attacks. Three students were killed and three were wounded, two seriously.
Lane wasn't subject to the death penalty because he was 17 at the time of the crimes.
Lane attended an alternative school for students who haven't done well in traditional schools. He was at Chardon waiting for a bus.
Lane pleaded guilty to three counts of aggravated murder, two counts of attempted aggravated murder and one count of felonious assault.
Daniel Parmertor and Demetrius Hewlin, both 16, and Russell King Jr., 17, were killed in the Feb. 27, 2012, rampage.
