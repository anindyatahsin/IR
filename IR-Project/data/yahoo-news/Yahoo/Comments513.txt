57% not likely to get in the market.  Bad move, watch a good stock say Caterpillar, Bristol myers, and see . BMY pays a div. close to 4% better than you get in a saving account- Cat just a great ind. stock to have

One would think that the amount of call open interest will force them to sell which should bring the price down hard. I've seen this before where the open interest is so much greater on the call side but the volume on expiration day still doesn't show any selling. Can anyone school me on this or direct me to a site that's helpful as most have not been. You'd think since most contacts expire worthless they'd be out to burn whichever side (calls or puts) has the highest amount... With the follwing info that i typed it has room to go down quite a bit... Even with them keeping the amount of the settlement for 1 case of many secret, it still won't go down.FOR 4OR 5 YEAR IT DID NOT MOVE OVER 25.00 DOL.

I'm looking at phizer should have gotten at 16 back then.  It seems like it doesn't move over 22.00.  Maybe now it will lokking for dividend stocks make more owning stock then in savings acct.

They parasite on old people.
