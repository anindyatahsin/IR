Hawaiian has much less in the aircraft Department,Southwest has 500 and change in the aircrafts.CEO Kelly made the company get stronger and bullish.He needs to give the ground department something now as they always get nothing.

AA should be good long term investment with upcoming merger

You must be kidding Dal's 3rd qtr profit was comparable to all other domestic airlines combined!!! Plus the refinery starting to paying dividends plus the 717 deal with LUV u all must be kidding!!

WHY IS Hawaiian not an airline,  20 jumbo jets, that is 20 more than southwest owns.  LCC is looking real good right now with the no hedgers and extremly low price

U.S. airways...look at the chart, buy on the dips. $18 - $22 by the end of summer!

CEO Kelly did a very bad job for the company,that why the LUV stock is not moving up.I am call him to resign.

dear AP, It's "airline companies"

Southwest is numero uno................

with crude-oil coming down ,betting on airlines have a better chance to win.
