hmmm- flavor &amp; fizz in water...?sounds like "soda"  - isn't that amazing!#$%$.

Years ago,  I remember quite clearly that it took the Coca-cola company to put the robust flavor in Tab.

Isn't it a little early for April Fools?  This is like an onion article.

I like my Water to Taste like Water....

Coke needs to start selling Coca Cola sweetened with sugar and not high fructose corn syrup.  I have to hunt around for Jewish Passover Coke or Mexican Coke because I avoid HFCS.  Or I drive 5 hours to Cleveland since the bottler there uses real sugar.

Call me crazy, but I love it when my water tastes like water.

When I'm thirsty, I reach for water. When I'm thirsty for soda I reach for water.

When the electricity is on, the pump in my well gives me 45psi of pressure forcing clean, delicious water through my pipes.  If the electricity goes off, the hand pump in the well still gives me clean, delicious water to drink and cook with.  A 55-gallon drum painted black and sitting on an 8-foot high stand allows the sun to heat the water for a comfortable shower or bath.  Always have more than one option.

Makes me think of the movie Idiocracy...."It has the electrolites plants crave!"

Buy 1 liter of club soda + 1 lemon = taste better + cheeperNothing like more phosphorus for the bones!!

Uh. So it isn't WATER then. I guess beer is water too, right? Idiocy. Now people will be convinced that this is "JUST AS GOOD FOR YOU AS WATER!!!" ... This country disappoints me.
