that lawyer looks totally honest.....seriously, i would trust this guy with my ex-wife's, husbands children....yeah, that works...

Typical NJ lawyer. This state should change its name from the "Garden State" to the "Corrupt State". The license plate would have a ball and chain logo !

A show of incredible ignorance, from a highly educated man. Good-bye fool, your life is now forfeit.

After being in jail for 4 years already ... and 80% off for marginal behavior - he should be out by the 4th of July.Ben Franklin, This Old House, Philadelphia

This guy could add +2 to my street cred.

Being a New Jerseyan this does not surprise me.The judges, prosecutors, trenton, rich and wealthy of this state are the biggest monumental corrupt crooks...like..ever!The rest of us here who live paycheck to paycheck and barely get by are fed to the wolves.If it was not for their overreacting jumpy stormtroopers hanging around every mile and a half on every road, things would be different. Much different.

This is great.
