I'm totally surprised that they are going to reopen it...they are threatening to close the Arizona Memorial, so why not the SOL?

I would LOVE to see that firework show!!!

Not part of the big budget cut I guess. Oh Wait.. that was then and this is now.

Keep it closed we cant afford this kind of stuff anymore with Obama's spending!

In the dumbed down USA freedom no longer means liberty as symbolized by the statue.  Freedom now means hedonism.

The late Great,United States of America,destroyed by a chicago community socialist organizer,with his obamacare,and open border's ?

What???  This must be a misprint, surely the WH has told them that the sequestration MUST impact the most people in the most used, desired, visited and hallowed grounds in these United States......

Will soon be a relic, seeing as our individual freedom is decaying like the copper of Lady Liberty.

I thought that the sky was still falling and Obama was still the hero that was going to save it all?

But Owe-bama won't reopen the White House for tours.
