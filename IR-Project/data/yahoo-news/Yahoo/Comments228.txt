Still does not give them the right to steal!!

'Seizure' is a good term for what's happening. The move is seizing up all kinds of activity in Europe and beyond. It's a good idea for the Caymen Islands and all the illegal loot stashed in their banks.

If they know what's good for them ,they wouldn't mess with Putin and his money are they'll lose their heads.

Nancy Pelosi heard about the idea of just grabbing money out of people's bank accounts and she peed her pants a little.

Propaganda. So now it is good they are robbing to cover the losses of the banks owed tho their own bad behavior because some anonymous "analysts say", a lot of Russian mob and corrupt politician money is deposited there? Why don't these same "analysts" say that American mob and corrupt politicians money is safe bacause it is in Grand Cayman?

ouch does that mean the big boys get hurt for a change

a mafia controlled police state being fleeced by world dominance authoritarians? if obama would just call a stand down on the russian attack.

Hey Russia, hows it feel to be a victim of the EU's socialist policies?

Thieves and corrupt politicians having ill gotten money taxed and taken?  Thanks for making my day!

- -  - - - - so now 'the people' have to bail out 'private business' - -  - - - - - - -______________ and you say CAPITALISM WORKS _______________________Warning: If Government can do this in Cyprus, Governments will do it anywhere -  - - including the USA - Britain - France - Ireland - Canada - Australia etc etc.Ask yourself - - - how well is that 'capitalism' working?and-How safe is YOUR MONEY in a bank account?Take your money and convert most of it into physical silver before your cash is nothing more than paper or the government decides it's ok to steal from you.

Oh, and we should trust Obama not to do the same? No thanks, U.S. government can't be trusted that is pretty well defined at this point

hows that hope and change working in russia?

I have to wonder, how much money does Romney hide there?

Percentage is small compared to what US citizens stack in other places in the world

Putin's money = Dirthy Money

I'm still checking to see if I have any sympathy for millionaires and thieves being taxed. Get back to me in a year and I may have come to a decision.

"Russia may in exchange ask Cyprus for information on the Cypriot companies registered by Russians"Gee, do you think so?

It behooves every man who values liberty of conscience for himself, to resist invasions of it in the case of others: or their case may, by change of circumstances, become his own.  Thomas JeffersonOops...looks like the Russian mafia chieftains may be taking a bit of a hit from their mafia bankers this year. Putin looks a little upset now, doesn't he? The words "Russian" and "criminal" are a duplication of terms.

How dare they tax money that is being laundered.

Russia have to help Cyprus, that is their favorite place for money laundering

Maybe Cypress should be annexed by Turkey then they can just pay all the bills and invest the Russian money where they think prudent.

Porr ruskis.
