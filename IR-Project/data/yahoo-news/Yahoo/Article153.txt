Palestinian attackers wound Israeli in West Bank

JERUSALEM (AP) â€” Israeli police say Palestinian attackers have shot and wounded an Israeli man in a drive-by shooting at a West Bank bus stop.
Spokesman Micky Rosenfeld says the Israeli, who is in his 60s, was shot in the leg in Monday's shooting near the Kedumin settlement in the West Bank.
Rosenfeld says two shots were fired from a Palestinian car, which then fled the scene.
The attack comes two days before President Barack Obama is due to visit the region.
The West Bank, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war and claimed by the Palestinians, has experienced a jump in violence in recent weeks.
Last week, a Palestinian youth was killed after throwing rocks at soldiers while an Israeli toddler was critically wounded when Palestinians threw rocks at a car.
