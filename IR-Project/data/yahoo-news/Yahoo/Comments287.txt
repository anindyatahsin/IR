The keep referring to "The deepest downturn since the great depression" . . . it's just "spin". . . The 1970's when Carter was president was much worse.  Manufacturing companies were closing by the droves, and the employment office had 5 lines stretched out the door and across the parking lot.  Mortgage interest rates were in the teens, and 90% of the realty sales people left their jobs.  Tool and equipment sales people stayed home, it cost more in gas to make sales calls than any sales they might get.. . . The only thing saving me was that banks only loaned what a person could afford for a house payment, and unemployment insurance along with a few part time jobs made ends meet.

Advance? I just want  a job I can hold onto longer than a couple of years. Jobs keep dying under me, as budgets are cut.

welcome to the big O's world........
