H3LL they are the only ones getting ahead while our nation falls to the bottom of Excellent Education in the world..

For-profit "education" companies are in it to make money, not provide a superior product.

Funny how we have so much more education now.......yet things that people made 50 years ago lasted longer and didnt break down as much.  We are stupid !

U of Phoenix is a hoax and has made a Brit a billionaire and several more. The students aren't qualified for a college degree to begin and drop out

Harvard uses Holywood through NY to DC to rape you

There would not be any need for private education if the government hadn't stepped in to remove dress codes, discipline and introduced insane measures like "No student left behind".There isn't a single corporation in the world that could stay in business if there were a "No worker left behind" law, yet we allow it in our places of learning.

I love private education. This is where the rich man sends his brats after he's made a mess of public education, and can watch as his off-spring advances and the riff-raff's brood stumble and fall. Thank you, Republicans for another lesson in why you are dangerous.

For profit education companies are a government boondoggle.

Have you ever notice the very very nice cars and houses that the professors and teachers live in in your town and city. talk about well off and you are paying for them
