Healthcare insurance rates will now "GO THRU THE ROOF" ---- Thanks Obama

Thank you obamacare!

Lots of people have died using pacemakers with faulty leads. Leads developed during a republican administration that did not force the FDA to do a good job. Why Obama is hated, is that Dems force Medical equipment companies to adhear to a tighter run FDA. Search the dispute between FDA workers in Austin Tx. FDA employees loyal to doing the right thing, turned in other FDA workers for passing MRI strengths harmful or deadly. This lax MRI guidline came out of the FDA during the BUSH presidential fiasco.

when will JNJ buy synthes ??????????
