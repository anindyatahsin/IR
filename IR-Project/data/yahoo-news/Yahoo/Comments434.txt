WVA better than the national average

Being as the Regime is doing all they can to keep this from happening, one has to wonder why it would drop....unless the Propaganda Dept is shi*ting us AGAIN.....

2,800 jobs wouldn't more than that number enter the work force after high school and college grad.?

WOO HOO! one-tenth of a percentage point!Joey OBiden was right. This is the summer of recovery.

8.1 percent is something to brag about, we are in the hand-basket and headed the wrong direction.

Oh, new jobs in mining and logging. The horror. People earning an honest living instead of bilking taxpayers on "green energy" schemes.

They are busting more ignorant  moronic low IQ moonshiners     that"s why !!

Thank god for steady leadership at the helm. We could have been all undone with another disconnected rich guy to start screwing things up again.

That is just the people that ran out of unemployment. I wish they would just say that instead of it has less claims, that most likely isn't the reason.

all we had to do was print money 80 billion a month... when we stop though.... if we ever do... its all over folksI have lived in Charleston WV.. The whole reason the unemployment is dropping is because they are all moving to Florida.. Not a joke.. When I lived there for 2 years I cant even tell you how many People I met that left WV for Florida.. LOL
