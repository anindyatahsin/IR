Well I guess the next book she writes will certainly mark THAT trail as one to avoid.

Maybe she needs to read the Hiking for Dummies  guidebook.

There are bold people and old people, but you really have to be charmed to be an old bold person.

Very unfortunate, yet entirely foreseeable at this time of year on that face. One would expect a a local expert to have better information.

Horrible way to go...RIP

If this didn't get them, research on the chapter for climbing frozen waterfalls would have.

mother nature is a #$%$

Terrible.

Taking unnecessary risks = future Darwin Award winner.

Brutal ... must have been a long night up there alone all busted up ... and missing her partiner.  Cheers to the rescue crew that managed to get in there in time to get her out alive.  Experienced no doubt ... but avalanches don't care how experienced you think you are ... they will take anyone who stands in their way.Why would an experienced guide be hiking when the avalanche danger is "considerable"?

We have her guide, it's a great resource. Hope she recovers and too bad about her partner. At least he was doing what he loved.

They had it coming, but dieing that way is a horrible way to die.  I hope that she'll recover from the tramua of losing her climbing partner

Sorry about that but if you want to play the game you must be ready to lose.

Putting yourself in harms way 'just for the fun of it' is not always as fun as the guide book says.  She will now mark that trail as 'unsafe.'  Closing the barn door.

Does it bear saying that one should take a pass on her "guidebooks" - or, perhaps read them as guides to what NOT to do.

"If they'd have had a gun..."Oh, never mind, I was trying to think like a liberal.

Note to self:  Buy a different book.

Ironic that she was writing on the topic of avalanches.

I wonder if he was a fan of the Colorado Avalanche
