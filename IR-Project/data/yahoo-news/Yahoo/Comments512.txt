dammit! it's been about 2 months since i recommended CSX as a solid investment, a rarity. reason being that the gov't has put a pinch on coal mining and removed all the major rail lines. the method behind their madness? to corner the market on transport, and make a killing by laying new tracks. not to mention, having an excuse for polluting the atmosphere. i know where MY money is going.

Why do we lag behind other countries such as China , Japan &amp; Korea with 21st century Rail that is so popular in these countries as well as the magnificent Rail systems of Europe ??If they can find the money why can`t we ???We have the tracks which would need upgrading for normal trains , but why not the high speed trains of other countries ??And WE are supposed to be the innovator country !!!

a tax cut for the railroads recently has helped them.....that's good for america

" The Union Pacific was the west and the west was the Union Pacific."

When we see Pantographs atop the locomotives of BNSF et alia, then we'll know they are finally thinking 21st Century!

Looks like a good day for all
