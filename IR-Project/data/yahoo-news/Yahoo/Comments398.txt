Ohhhhh...! The intoxicating power of a kitty cat !!

.....me love you long time for cyber secrets.

His LinkedIn profile says he works on cybersecurity? Is this something that should be out in the open on the internet. Maybe he was posting himself to see what kind of offers would come his way. Sorry but I think the people responsible for security should be found deficientin their duties too. I never heard of anything so utterly ridiculous. Who is running that group, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck?

Brilliant. Special Forces lt colonel, defense contractor, 59, "in love" with Chinese 32 years younger on temp visa and nobody gives any attention. Come on, is this another joke or what?

Forget about the hacking, you hire the spy's in the first place and after how much money spent to "protect" the nations secrets? What a joke it has all become! I know, create a new agency to review the reviews of the other agencies to stop this! Wanna bet this individual has a liberal view of America just like Obama and his party!Surprised the left is not demanding some sort of medal!

it's the Madam Butterfly Effect, hope he checked under the hood first

Can be punishable by death.
