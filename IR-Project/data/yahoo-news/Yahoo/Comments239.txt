Also there is not seating for everyone, and it is realized I may not have a seat, certainly. Only do not give any recognition to the terrible things Mugabe has done

Why wasnt he arrested?

He obviously tithed well from all the wealth he stole!  The church certainly continues to protect their own kind regardless of how wrong they are.

Italy is just as good a place to ding this #$%$ as any other country. It too difficult to get him in his one of his castles. He'll be out in the open in Italy. Can't believe no ones setting him up at this very moment.

Mugabe's should be arrested for crime against humanity. They should've never allow him to enter EU member state.

Italy should have put that spear chucker back on his plane and tell him that he is not welcome in the EU.

Rhodesia was such a better country than Zimbabwe.
