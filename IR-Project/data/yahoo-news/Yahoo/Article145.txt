Lawmaker wonder about NKorean leader's 'stability'

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” The chairman of the House Intelligence Committee says the U.S. just doesn't know about "the stability" of North Korea's young leader, who has threatened pre-emptive nuclear attacks on Washington.
Republican Rep. Mike Rogers of Michigan says Kim Jong Un is trying to "prove himself" to his military and the military is eager for "saber-rattling" for its own self-interest.
North Korea also has said recently that it no longer will recognize the armistice that ended the 1953 Korean War.
The Pentagon said Friday that it will spend $1 billion to add 14 interceptors to an Alaska-based missile defense system, responding to what it called faster-than-anticipated North Korean progress on nuclear weapons and missiles.
Rogers tells CNN's "State of the Union" that the North Koreans seem to be looking for some "provocations."
