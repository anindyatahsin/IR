I also work for one of the major beverage companies as a route salesman for the past 18 years in Texas they pay well ...benefits are top notch as well as a nice pension retitement plan. Yes, new hires are no longer are eligible for pension and salaried management no longer get401k match $$$. But front line sales are paid decent. There have been years where I made more $$$ than my district managers and supervisors.  .

I work for one of the big soda company's and they pay me great with great benefits. I'm not Management I'm one of the guys on the front lines. My wife can stay home with both our kids and I live in California . We're not even close to be a oil company.

As these compainies fail to pay decent wages to the employee's they find ways to pay millions for celebrities in the commercials, " hey look, it's Justin Beiber, we need to hurry and go buy that Coke or Pepsi ! "

Beverages companiesI am sure this country is making words!!!!!surely Beverage Companies.Another stupid one isThe most Winningest!!!

OBAMA SUCKS

Beverages companies = The New oil companies.. Time to go on a crusade against yet another Big evil industry.. To make the world a safer place..
