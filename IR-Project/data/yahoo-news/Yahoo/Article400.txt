163 lose jobs after SC call center closes




HEMINGWAY, S.C. (AP) -- Safe Auto Insurance has abruptly closed its call center in South Carolina, leaving more than 160 people without a job.
                  
Safe Auto Executive Vice President Mark LeMaster said it was a hard decision made after the company concluded it needed to reduce its work force. The 163 employees were told at a meeting Tuesday morning.
                  
Most of the people out of work were customer service employees, although some insurance agents were also let go. LeMaster says the workers will be paid and keep their benefits for the next two months.
                  
The call center in Hemingway opened 10 years ago.
                  
Safe Auto is keeping open a call center in Kentucky and two call centers in Ohio, where the company is located.
