Pa. college awaits answers as it mourns coach

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) â€” At least one player from a Pennsylvania women's college lacrosse team remains hospitalized as police search for answers to why the team bus veered off the Pennsylvania Turnpike.
The Saturday morning crash killed 30-year-old Seton Hill University coach Kristina Quigley, her unborn child and the bus driver.
Seton Hill player Amanda Michalski remained hospitalized Monday. A Penn State-Hershey Medical Center spokeswoman says Michalski is in fair condition.
Twenty-three players and coaches were aboard the bus when it crashed on the way to a game at Millersville University.
Quigley was about six-months pregnant. She died of her injuries at a hospital. The bus driver, 61-year-old Anthony Guaetta of Johnstown, died at the scene.
Pennsylvania State Police Trooper Rob Hicks says it will be weeks before police determine why the bus crashed.
