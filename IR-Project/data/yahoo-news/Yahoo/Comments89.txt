How do you spell disfunctional?  ITALY

Unusual that the government is a function of both Houses. Usually it's a function of the "lower House" in parliamentary democracies. Anyone know the details of why this is? I'm not finding an answer in my searches.

I,ve heard that graft is a way of life there. Why would this change?

political mafia wars...

italy......2 Trillion euros in public debt.....how can this not be understood? ....how can this not be seen clearly?cuts to govt spending.....and let the Depression begin.......all they are doing is 'kicking the can down the road'.....sound familiar?

Is this the future of America. Are we looking at our own reflection. can we learn from forsight.

You will overcome!  My dear italia.
