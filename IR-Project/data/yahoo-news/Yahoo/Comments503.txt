We should delay all road construction until we can figure out what takes so long. There are several small projects in NY that have taken years to complete. They complete about 6 inches a day.

Here comes the Unions lobbiest! Hundreds of millions might be delayed...... oh no you wont!

So you get rid of a perfectly good tax system and now you have to stabilize the budget because not enough revenue is coming in? A Republican government gets rid of a system that has worked for a 100 years and now they have a budget crisis.  Who did not see this coming?

By the time the good citizens of Kansas wake up to knee high potholes, Brownback and his cronies will have long departed from Kansas.

Live within your means.

GOP once again blocks jobs.   Wow, when will they realize the American people have put the GOP in an all time low rating and 2014 the people, once again will take down the GOP by their votes./ The GOP are not for the American people. Just ask Grover Norquist

oohh, more scare tactics, Texas has no state income tax and they have great highways coming out of their #$%$

Good.  there is way too much construction, especially in the summertime.  seems like half of the interstate is torn up then.

You are in Kansas, anymore.

Kansas is in the running to be the Capital of TARDLAND.It all comes down to the basic fact that you only get what you pay for.....you want basic services such as infrastructure, you have to pay for it.

Who needs roads?  This is Kansas.  As long as you have a gun and a tractor to pull your plow, you'll be o.k. in Kansas.
