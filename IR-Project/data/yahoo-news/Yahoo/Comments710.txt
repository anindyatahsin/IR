I guess they don't screw their employees enough to get the approval of Goldman Sachs

When goldman sucks says sell, buy.  When goldman sucks says buy, sell.  It's not that they don't know what they're doing, it's that their business model is deceive

Clearly this analyst failed to listen to the last conference call and note that they led the way in cutting coffee prices to consumers (due to the commodity price drop of coffee) to increase sales and forced competition to follow.  Their sales are on fire.  However, this is fine with me as a buy and hold shareholder - gives me the opportunity to acquire more at a lower price.

Who is Goldman Sachs Jews shmok

Maybe karma is coming back for all of their efforts to stop Prop. #37 by donating money for the No on Prop #37 campaign to prevent people from knowing what is in their food.  The President of Smuckers also weezled their way onto the Organic Trade Association Board by taking the place of what was supposed to be an organic farmer.  While holding that position the President of Smuckers gave an award to a GMO producer, and tried to change the laws of what ingredients would be allowed in organic products so that GMO ingredients could be used in certified organic.  Didn't realize that Smuckers also owns Jiff PB and Folgers Coffee.  Two products I never buy.  Looking at ingredients of their grape jelly:  CONCORD GRAPE JUICE, HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP, CORN SYRUP, FRUIT PECTIN, CITRIC ACID, SODIUM CITRATE.  No doubt grapes sprayed with pesticides, and the corn syrups are GMO.  Since they own Santa Cruz Organic Juice, just goes to show their heart is not into supporting organic.  They just bought the company to own it, and keep it from growing much.
