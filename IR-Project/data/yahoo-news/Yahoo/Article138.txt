Official: Barbra Streisand to perform in Israel

JERUSALEM (AP) â€” An Israeli government official says Barbra Streisand is coming to town.
The official says the celebrated American Jewish singer will perform in Israel in June in honor of Israeli President Shimon Peres' 90th birthday.
The official was speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to brief reporters about the matter. There was no immediate comment from Streisand.
The official says Streisand's appearance will coincide with a yearly speaker's conference headed by the Israeli president. This year's conference takes place June 18-20 in Jerusalem.
President Peres told reporters five years ago that Streisand was set to perform at that year's presidential conference, but she didn't show up.
Israeli media said Streisand would also perform in two concerts.
