So it begins!!  Governments have become powerful enough to simply TAKE citizens' hard-earned money to bailout the irresponsible money management of banks!  WOW!!!

If O has his way we will be heading the way of Cyprus!

take $40 of speculation

Just wait for the wind to change direction and prices will go back up

And the World Depression comes closer?

If they did that here, bankers would die like flies.

Now wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I just read oil was up a little, so gas around here went up 20cents a gallon.  Now it went down.  Will I be able to say by the end of the day gas will be down 20 cents a gallon?   MMMMooooooooooooooahahahahahah

Frederick, it will be even worse. Maybe those doomsday preppers are on to something. Maybe this is why the Obama administrator wants to take away Assault weapons because they know we are screwed

When a government is big enough to give you everything you want, is strong enough to take everything you have away.

Biofuels alone have kept gas prices over $1 cheaper than they otherwise would have been without them. The three strongest supporters in history for biofuels in DC Are/were Tom Vilsak, Steven Chu, and Barack Obama. Complain all you want, but competition in the marketplace is the ONLY thing that will drive down fuel prices. Not Keystone, Not domestic drilling. The market simply doesnt work that way. Support Renewable AMERICAN sources of energy.
