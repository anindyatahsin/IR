Tsunami nailed the final nail the coffin, another quake of 9 magnitude will surely fill in the dirt.

Must suck living next or in the ring of fire. I hope the people of Japan can find peace from nature's wrath.

The next major one will sink Japan as Edgar Cayce predicted!

If such a quake were to hit, surely GODZILLA will be the reason.  All hail GODZILLA!!!!

the quick demise of japan is good for the world.

I did a study....if I go outside in a rain storm ill get wet....how much money does a cash strapped country pay to have someone do these figures?...our country does it too....whats the effects of smoking meth if you are a monkey...no wonder the world is headed to the trash...

what is the preferred method of hygiene in japan?

2.3T was the money Abe (Japanese premier) paid imf/obama as a ransom to not to cause anymore magnitude-7 earthquakes.  Abe did this by printing more money as per the instructions of frb and worldbank.  Amazing this also what b-o is doing to steal the life-savings of the americans

God cursed japan. There is nothing that can save you.more "yellow" journalism from yahoo. LOL!
