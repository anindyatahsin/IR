Thousands without power after storms rake South

JACKSON, Miss. (AP) â€” Tens of thousands of people are still without power after powerful winds and massive hail hammered the South.
In Mississippi, hail broke car windows and pelted homes and businesses after the storms passed through Monday. Some hail was as large as baseballs in some areas in and around the capital of Jackson.
In Alabama, utility officials say straight-line winds gusting as high as 80 mph toppled trees and power lines. One person had to be rescued from a house in Rainbow City after a tree fell on it. More than a dozen people in that state were sent to hospitals.
Alabama Power says some 98,200 people were still without power around 6 a.m. Tuesday. The utility says it sent out crews early this morning and is bringing in reinforcements from other states.
