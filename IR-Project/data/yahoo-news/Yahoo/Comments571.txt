unless the devil is depicted as a white man every one is ticked off. I remember in the Passion of The Christ, everyone was all upset because the devil looked like a woman. I am sure he is able to shapeshift and appear to be anybody he wants to be as he is not held to one form or another.

Satan threatened to sue for slander!

Obama does spend a lot of time with his Hollywood buddies.  How do we know it's NOT him in that show?

This is so funny. God sure does have a sense of humor. Doesn't he?

lol not saying that there is a connection but isn't there a story that a man will come forth claiming to help right all the wrongs and bring fairness to an unjust world and in the end that fellow is the anti-christ?

It is sooooo funny to see the libs get their panties in a bunch when someone says something about their messiah.

Hey liberals, stop making a big deal of this, it is only a movie - remember how many times you told conservatives this?

I thought about this last night after reading this story - tell me what these same people who are complaining would have said if the actor had not been used just because he looked too much like Obama?  They would have been screaming racial discrimination.  Do you REALLY think the producers picked the actor for the part and tried to make him look like Obama?  Really?

I kind of thought it was funny.  I mean the picture I saw caught Obama with one of those looks that you only get with candid photography.  I have caught several people with those kinds of looks and they always get a laugh.

If it was an accident it was a great accident.If you haven't seen the photos, don't make this into a racism thing.  I saw the photo from the movie and he does look like Obama.

besides the bible says that satan is the most beautiful thing GOD has ever made, and that for sure aint obama

This made me think of Ace Ventura Pet Detective.  When his landlord is like, "Ventura!" and Ace answers, "yes Satan? Oh sorry sir, you sounded like someone else."

So now a bad guy in a t.v. show can't remotely resemble Obama in anyway without getting the liberals undies in bunch? Until they come put with a show that directly makes fun of Obama like they had for Bush, you should shut the hell up.

Typical nonsense brought to you by the Democratic party....

I don't reject the idea...

Dismiss all you want, they look like brothers.....

in the mASS media attempt to protect Obama at all costs, they lose prospective.  does the actor portraying Satan look a spitting image of Obama?  YES.  did people point that out?  YES.  what is the issue you are making mASS media?  Beck is correct here.  relax.  you in the mASS media are scared of your own shadows to even chuckle at the similarity.

Explains why he's hiding his birth certificate. Who's your daddy?

Many Obama voters didn't set their clocks ahead one hour this month because they can't count that high.I believe,nothing is done,by chance,but some things,just fit in place.Satin is called the Devilwho is known a deceiver, deceptive,liar of man kind,By their fruits,you shall know knowthem. I would say the Image/Picture suites Barrack Obama,to a Tee. We have a form ofsatin in the oval office,now and needs to be removed,with all dispatch and A.S.A.P.

anything to play the race card it seems.

Oh come on, you knew there would be some sort of controversy over a series that discusses the bible without portraying it as something bad.  Satan gets an A+ for his efforts since WW2.

The great thing is that more people will tune in just to see the comparison and ratings will continue to go up.

When the actor heard he looked like Obama, he was quite upset.

I knew in 2008 Obama was the Devil

If Satan had a son he would look like O.......! Fulty

GOD only knows for sure.

I pre-ordered the DVD yesterday based on this.

Democrats, you should watch it.  You'll love King Herod.  He slaughters babies too, just like you do.Well you know what they say,if the shoe fit--well there you go !!

Satan should be offended by this comparison.

THIS JUST IN........the devil has said he is mad because people are comparing him to Obama.

Satan is now raising hell in Hell for comparing him to Obama.

We who live by the bible and worship the Lord, are being punished each day.  Those who live a life of sin and talk against the Lord, are being held high and glorified.  It is written that these days will come.  The devil will have his time to rule, but that time will be cut short.  Keeping our faith strong, and knowing that God Is With Us, will lead us to the eternal life in heaven that we were promised.  God bless us all.

as much as liberals and the demoncrats hate god, the bible series is breaking records on number of viewers, and it infuriates the godless demoncrats.fox news also leads the pack on numbers of viewers, and again, it infuriates the godless demoncrats and liberals.god bless america

Barak HuSatan Obama.

Just the radical liberal media stirring up more trouble... and... more of their propaganda

He's wearing a campaign hoodie.  Now we know it's true.

If I was the devil, I'd be pi55ed.I don't know,seems to me that Satan(the universal evil) has and is much better at his job(career,calling?) then our Community-Organizer-In-Chief has been at his (president with a small "p")!

Obama is for gay marriage, abortion, lie's all the time, hates Israel. YUP, he is definitely an anti christ.

I would say that, Yes, I believe he is closer to satan than anything else!

I saw the devil in big o before the tv show.

I'm not so willing to dismiss the idea of God taking this opportunity to plant a collective seed in this way.   What better way for God to get his thoughts out to the most people possible than to broadcast it to the world.    God works in strange ways.    I'm sure the Producers never gave it a thought, which makes it all the more eery how similar Obama looks like Satan in the show.    I know I've scrolled it away in the back of my mind.

Subject: Great Editorial - Just one Sentence"A pen in the hand of this president is far more dangerous than a gun in the hands of 200 million law-abiding citizens."Subject:  Judge JudyJudge Judy to Prostitute:"When did you realize you were raped?"Prostitute (wiping away tears): "When the check bounced."The American Public will soon reach the same conclusion

Well, I'm not surprised that yahoo is still trying to sell this bogus #$%$ to the uninformed voters of the progressive (communist) party even though this guy has been playing satan in movies back when obamao was still a foreign exchange student in the USA. Everybody needs to wake up and see we are being taken over by anti-American forces and their propaganda starts right here on yahoo.

I think it suit Obama well!!!

Evil comes in many differnt forms.....obama is just one of them. lol.

Hmmmm???  and Biden is "Going to lose his Soul"  ?????The office deserves respect. Obama does not.

Well Obama's cover has been blown.

The best part of heaven will be no Democrats.

Coincidence? I've known all along that Obama was the devil, this merely confirms it!

It takes more than hollering in the church to make a Christian.

I bet you Obama called them up crying.

They are both natives of the same area of the world,  so it makes sense that there may be a resemblance.  Does not seem to resemble many native Hawiaans however.

You steal from the producers and give to the lazy....Satanic = Socialism

The ultimate authority does not dismiss it. That's the only One that counts.

Satan told Jesus that if he rejected God's plan for him, he could get "FREE" healthcare!Satan wants the rich to pay their fair share as well !!!

It's hard to hide the truth.

dang i though he done a better job playing as devil then acting as president

If Obama had a hoodie he would look like Satan

The only time the media actually digs is when there is something negative about Obama that has to be DISPROVEN, something that looks like they can blame the GOP OR something/someone religious that can be discredited.  Journalism is dead

If if looks like a duck and quacks like a duck it MUST be a duck. LOL

Isnt our PRESS remarkable? They can find every woman Tiger Woods has had an affair with, their text messages, photos, recordings, cause of family fights even golf wedge she used on him &amp; the car!But same press corp cant seem to find Obamas BC, college papers, or anyone who knew him in college, how he paid for it, what passports he used or how he applied for financial aid available only to foreign students!In re: to Obama 62 million voted w/o prior knowledge thanks to our press corp &amp; mediaThree significant historical events have been eclipsed by Obama:1) Jimmy Carter will no longer be looked upon as the worst president in American history;2) Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton will no longer be recognized as the greatest liars in presidential history;3) Clinton's stain on Monica's dress, and what that did to White House in general and the office of the president specifically, will forever pale in comparison to the stain and stench of Obama.

Obama: "If I had a son he would look just like Trayvon Martin."  Satan:  "If I had a son he would look just like . . .."

Did not think about when I watched - Great series   - But when I think of obomanation it fits

More chatter about this by liberals than the 4 deaths in Bengahzi. Shows where their priorities lie!Is Satan's wife fat too?

I can hear Obummer now... if I had a son he would look just like him.

It is not the fault of the producers that Obama looks like the devil

Such nonsense is right –liberals just need to be angry about something---they are very un happy people

Satan is the essence of corruption.  And since Obama has now eclipsed Clinton as the most corrupt president in history, it is only fitting that he should do a cameo as Satan in this movie.

Satan has just filed a suit against the producers for defamation of character !!!

Just a little humorous post to ease tensions:::::::Jesus(The Real Messiah) stopped by my house last night. He told me He went to meet with the anti-christ but all he found was an "Empty Chair".......................

Obama quote - "I am a practicing Christian" then goes on to support gay marriage and abortion. Satan is deception, need I say more?

If the shoe fits

Is that why the White House smells like sulfur?Every time I see obama's face or hear his voice, I smell brimstone.

LOL Obama is satan. They got it right without even trying

I was fortunate to catch the British Mystery Players on tour here in the U.S. They had an interesting solution. The two actors who played God/Jesus and Devil/Satan switched roles every other performance.

Satan is a better man than barry soetoro

The comparison was not really fair to Satan!

If the sandals fit...................

Al Gore is going to play Noah and blame the flood on global warming.

They were going to make it an all Democrat production, but they couldn't find three wise men in the whole party.

Satan has had a balanced budget for thousands of years. Obama has yet to produce one.

Bill Clinton plays a Roman soldier, splooging on a harlot.Satan has filed a lawsuit in Federal Court for Defamation of Character.  You can't insult the devil and get away with it.

Methinks they protesteth too much.

Hairy Weed would have made a fine Satan character too.

God forbid you say anything about this baby.

There may be a slight resemblance in appearance but I think Obama resembles Satan much more in his actions. He allows for the killing of  babies in late term abortions, he lies, he steals, he is very secretive, devious. Yes, his actions truly do emulate those of Satan.

I will quote CNN when SNL made a video of Jesus gunning down Romans.  "If you don't like what you see, turn the channel.  It is a free country."

In the movie, Satan sees Noah's ark and tells Noah "You didn't build that!"

I'd say it's Satan that should be insulted

Obama is the devil I knew it.

It is not Satan's fault that he and Obama bear a striking resemblance.Looks like an older Obama. The question is: Does the devil give out free things???

Obama a fellow Christian? Someone must have redefined Christian. Obama is for gays, abortion, the Muslim Brotherhhood, against Israel and he doesn't believe that he needs to enforce our laws. Doesn't sound very Christian to me. Where are the good fruits?

The producers of the show would also like to thank the Obama-loving media for jumping to his "rescue" so strongly and giving them so much free publicity with all this drivel.

Another worthless Yahoo story that needs a pic.....

I saw the scene and how anyone could see Obama in Satan's face is way beyond me.  The media must be hard up for news!!

yep Saten came Back as a president......This President Has all the Vaules of Saten.....Lying Cheating....and presenting Him self As A Christen......

If it looks like a duck and smells of sulphur it must be Barry.

I'd like to see which other bible series this actor portrayed Satan before the film date of the History channel "Bible" series.The execs agenda is uncanny!

The only people who think this Satan character looks like the President  are the ones who voted him in.

Ask yourself this...............Does Obama look like Satan or does Satan look like Obama?In the movie, they had to get an extra wide chariot for Mrs. Satan.

The movie producers dismiss it.....normal productive Americans don't....

Obama's just doing the  devil's work, trying as hard as he can to destroy 'one nation under God' and its just coincidental that he looks like his boss.

;hard not to miss the connection

I seem to remember satan looking like Elizabeth Hurley in Bedazzled.

Actions speak louder than looks.  Obama IS Satan.

At least this guy has a birth certificate

Satan has legions. Obama has liberals.

Freedom of Speech is for Liberals only. Sheesh!

A rather minor offense considering what the left wing news medias have called Pres. Bush.that's Trayvonne's daddy!

I've seen a resemblance for many years. Long before the TV miniseries.

They are both evil.

"Both Mark and I have nothing but respect and love our president, who is a fellow Christian," ?????   If he's a Christian I'm a freakin' poodle.

Who Knew (Obama is Satan)?.... Oh, just 47% of us.

Obama's not satan, he's the antichrist

Well....if ihe walks like a duck....looks like a duck....quacks like a duck....he must be Satan.....

I don't see why everyone is so upset that the President found a part time job. He only takes care of the nation's business part of the time anyway.

Barry Beelzebub.

They really are one in the same. Just wait and see.obama aint satan...hes just one of his minions

Obama must be moonlighting.

I'm waiting for the Big O in a commercial that says "I'm not a President, but I played one in D.C...."

It CAN'T be Obama, Satan has a PLAN...

well barry can Be a Stand-in .....Thats His Next Job acting like Satan...he's Got it Down Pat......

Hillary plays a Nazerene women whom Jesus cures of clots.  He tells her "Go and overeat no more".

Satan will appear in whatever form he needs to in order to get the better of you. Nice to know the liberals are finally seeing Obama for who he really is. LMBO!

If the shoe fits, wear it!

I thought President Bush's head on a pike in Game of Thrones was humorous and this is no different. Were Liberals upset about that like they are about this?

of course it's nonsense; but liberals are easily offended and always victims of something.Pelosi makes a cameo as one of the gargoyles in the architecture.

Hillary's in the movie too.  She plays the ox in the manger scene.

Go no further for evidence of the mainstream media's adoration of the obama. The fact that most of the media feels a need to defend the fraud president over this trite issue cements the utter biased  aspect of news reporting. Is it any wonder that so many people "think" obama is such a great president. The media has bent over backwards to @ ss  kiss this inept leader for far too long covering up every lie, diminishing every flaw and boasting every non accomplishment. With the failure of the media to report the full truth it allows the failure of obama as a leader? to continue. When our rights and our freedoms get slowly stripped away by big goverment we can thank the mass media for being the accomplice to the crime.

Satan didn't raise my taxes, cut spending on useful programs, while increasing spending on frivolous ones including aid to terrorist sponsoring countries.

Another difference between Satan and Obama is that Satan believes in God.

It was a little obvious when Satan told Jesus to turn the rock into a food stamp.

New Hollywood litmus test rule.  All actors that look like a politician will be suspended until the politician is no longer in office.

Thinnest black skin on the planet.

yep,thats him!....lol I didnt know he acted in movies,as wall as acted as a president!

They got a Sandra Fluck look-a-like to play the slutty lady they almost threw stones at.A Timmy Geithner look-a-like plays the tax collector who doesn't pay his taxes.

If Satan had a son would he look like the actor who portrays Satan in this show?

Lets see. Obama's for Abortion, Gay Marriage , and mocked the Bible in a speech several years ago. I think its a perfect fit !

The comparisons must be really insulting to the devil

Why the comparison?  The devil has a much better economic platform.

Lucifer's Assistant, Obama...er...Satan.

Satan's always hoping for change.

The connection is obvious to me

did Obama borrow Thugvon's(Trayvon Martin FL) hoodie for the film ?

If I had been cast in this role, they'd say Satan looks like a young Robert Redford.  Ha.They can say whatever they want.  Actions speak louder than words, and their actions have the truth backing them up.

the demos/marxist/communist hate all forms of religion because they cannot control religion, if they can't control it they want to destroy it

Obama's EVIL transcends "Democrat vs Republican"....this is much bigger than political ideology...Obama is EVIL! ....PLEASE...Google: 'President Psycho' and see what a monster we have elected twice!

Obama = SatanTold you so !!!

Not satan, maybe antichrist

Hey can you see the resemblance of Satan, Obummer and the little dead hoodie boy from the Orlando, Florida hood?  Too bad Zimmermann ain't following him like he followed Martin!

If satan has a son he'd look like Barak.

No way, Satan actually gets results, this guy, not so much.

since when do democrats care about God, Bible or Devil anyway?

Obama is more of a Jar Jar Binks type.Just like eric holder was dismissed for selling guns to Mexican cartel members !!!

Then why was Mrs. Satan munching on lobster and caviar in the movie?

"If I had a grandson, he would look like Treyvon Martin" - Satan 2012

"How dare you compare me to him!!" -  Satan

So who owns the History Channel right now?

Obama-Satan connection... sounds about right to me. Satan prob doesn't like the compassion tho!

I still say "spittin image"

Glad they have the highest respect for obama because everybody I know thinks he's an evil creep who wants to destroy our country.

But what an insult to satan.

It wasn't just in the last few weeks that obama and Satan looked alike. We have seen it for over four years. God's punishment for being misled by Satan/obama will take a terrible toll on obama followers, i.e.: democrats. Good riddance you commie btards.LOL.  LOL.  If the shoe fits...wear it...Deluded Libtards be damned.

LMBO !  Well, if the shoe fits?

There are many many signs already have been on display:1. Obama's presidential crest fell from the podium.2. A fly landed right in the middle of Obama's forehead3. All the tragedies, natural or man made happening in the country.4. And now the resemblance to Satan...What other signs are people waiting to see so they can connect all the dots?Obama eating grass in the field?

Satan was known to hop on Chariot One and head to Sodom and Gomorrah whenever there was work to do.  As they say, "whatever happens in S&amp;G stays in S&amp;G".

How can they dismiss the connection? it's right there in his name. Barak HuSATAN Obama.

If anyone was going to look like the devil it would be Joe Biden.

Satan looks like Obama , or Obama looks like Satan, I'm not real sure...

Pleased to me you hope you guessed my name.....but what is puzzling you is the nature of my game.

Intentional or not, it IS rather humorous.  "Satan" really does look like our president and our president does appear to be wanting to damage our country...which IS evil!!!

This was obamas reward for backing HOLLYWOOD AND HIS GAY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.......and the role is fitting.Obama, If I had a father he would have looked like Mehdi Ouzaani...

We all knew it.  Just didn't want to admit it.

I wonder if the DVD release will have the standard "any resemblance to a real person, dead or alive, is purely coincidental" comment.      I have not seen the series, but the pictures posted on the web really do look like BO.

they all look alike.  Devils that is...

Brilliant work on the shows producer, should be nominated for Emmy award!

I think Roma is being polite.  She's Catholic and played an angel on TV.

Sandra Fluck is going to play the horr.

Who in hell is Satan?

Well if it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck.

I would dismiss it too. Satan is competent at what he does....Obama not so much.Oh, I see. Film a porno with a look alike for Sarah Palin and your expressing your first amendment rights. A Evil One who looks like Obama and you should not be allowed to do it!!! Gotcha!!

They aren't going to dismiss this that easily. Without a doubt the actor is an aged O'Barry.  The Lord is sending American a warning that must be noted.  Messages are sent to us all the time and people just shrug them off as coincidences.  This message is loud, clear and in our faces!

OMG....the devil does look like Obama???

To be more accurate it should have been Cheney's face, that is the real devil !

"I am not a #$%$" - Satan

You mean there's TWO of them?  I thought one was bad enough.

So Satan wears Obama campaign hoodies too?

Hey, he is playing the part, Obama, that is. Every one has often wondered what the devil looked like, now we know.

was recently asked, if Jesus came to my door, would I open it?No way! He looks like a hippy. Why would I let a hippy in my house? Or if it was really Jesus, he would want my money. NO. Go away hippy! You cannot have any of my bacon! Besides, Jesus would not need to knock. He has the key to everything. Go get your own bacon! Besides, everyone has cell phones now. He would call first, to let us know it was him. (my phone rings and plays Funky Cold Medina) "Hello?" "Yes, this is Jesus, give me your bacon." "No, son of god, this bacon belongs to ME!" So I texted him a picture of my bacon. That is all he gets. But then he told his dad on me. So I gave him my bacon. Take my bacon, jesus! Then I got a text from the devil. He (of course) was eating my bacon! It was all a trick! So I went to the store and bought more bacon. Take that Mr. Devil. But it was not the same. So I called the real jesus. He understood. He came up with a plan. A plan to get my bacon back! Long story short and two hours later me and jesus were eating the devil's bacon in the back of a white hearse that was being pulled by a lone donkey named Steve. But that is a story for another day. Moral of this story, however is: do not trust jesus. For he just might be the devil and only want your thick cut bacon.

IS IT????The devil's planning to file a defamation lawsuit as we speak....

well, the media scored on this one. i wont be able to watch this ever again  without thinking about the president...and not in a very nice way either.

M....MicheleA....andB....BarackU.....unitedS......statesMabus has been exposed.

First I must say that this series is a very inaccurate portrayal of God's Word.  I have discontinued watching it for this reason.  I did see the temptation segment however.  It was one of the few segments that was done well.  And the Satan character did remind me of Obama.  I think Satan would be pleased with that connection whether intentional or not.

Besides Obama NOT being a Christian, he doesn't hold a resemblance to the actor.

Jesus says, "Man does not live by government cheese alone."

Does he have reason to worry about a comparison?

I know that Satan is the bad guy but why put him down like this?

Don't tell me it's total non-sense when I can see the resemblances in their faces!

Ahhhhh we're so sensitiveI love it, they are right on the money with this Devil....the truth will set you free....!!

Could of fooled me...lol

If the shoe fits wear it.

I think GODS trying to tell us something !

Is there anything more hypocritical than a liberal?

LOL, I think the image was Socialist Obummer, which is appropriate for Satan's right hand man.

Obama is not the devil. He will take away your freedoms, support sexual deviants, favor islam and serve satan, but he is no devil!!!

Don't you know that freedom of speech applies to Liberals only?

Uhhh, the President is no Christian.  A wolf in sheep's clothing perhaps, but that's it.

At least we now know Obama's "country of origin."How's the saying go, "If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck..."

To anyone that owns and operates a small business, obama has long been the anti-christ.

Wish I could dismiss obama

I would just claim that it's art, that's what people do when they urinate on the cross and defile Christianity.

If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck........

The clown journalist in the media have to protect President Obama who they view as a god and that's all that's to it, but the media along with Hollywood is predominantly white, most liberal journalist joined the civil rights movement as an excuse to avoid the draft and stay out of Vietnam, they got their start because they were white at a time blacks were fighting for their civil rights, it's white liberals who play the race card against anybody who disagrees with them but ignore the fact that they practice the same racism that they claim they despise, so what do white journalist do when they  made a career out of keeping their institutions lily  playing the race card and are forced to report objectively on Americas first African American President, they put halos on his head and proclaim him a god, nobody likes a bunch of butt kissers, especially when their President and is on the receiving end of their affection, President Obama might say publicly he appreciate their affection but privately he despises them.

Dismiss if you want but it's clear to me.  Satan and Satan Jr.

I don't subscribe to any this Obama being the Devil stuff,Because I think all "Make believe" is exactly that,But I haven't seen ONE THING coming from Obama,That I thought was good for America,&amp; that alone tells me, --- That he's trying to bring us down ...

Ask anyone in Iran.  They'll tell you who the Great Satan is.  They won't mention Ouzanni.

The look in Obama's eyes is a lot scarier than Satan's.For as much name calling and finger pointing as the left does its pretty funny to see them whinning and sniveling over this. Let the actor earn a living please!

Obama and this actor are both ugly dudes and they do resemble each other.It is what it is in this case.

Yes I think they favor.  But that is not the point.  He was playing Satan and Jesus told him where to go.  If you don't think so read the Bible.  The greatest Book ever written.

Are you kidding!! Look at the similarities!!They both have two eyes, a nose and a mouth. And dark skin too.They're identical.Not.

Well, it is what it is. Conincidence or whatever, sure does scream the truth now doesn't it. One of the same. Pretty accurate if you sk me.

Hey, evil just looks evil how could they not pick a look alike.

funny....Hugo Chavez resembles King Herod on the show.

The devil - no way...  Tool of the devil .. maybe

I don't think Obama is The Devil, but I also don't think, like many do, that he is the Messiah.  No horns, no halo, and no idea what he's doing.

Obama is Satan.Satan's poll numbers have dropped off big time in the last couple weeks.

Freedom of speech is a wonderful thing!

Its very tough on the liberals when they had Oboma depicted as their pope then to see him as the other half of the american population sees him,"The Devil".

Typical liberal whining.The used the perfect person for the part in the show, because I know anytime the devils name is mentioned, Obama's name is the first name that comes to me.His destruction of the morals in this country are defiantly bringing us closer all to the end of times!

One Thing For Sure Obama can Never Play Jesus.....

Nobody with eyes can deny the similarity in the two photos side by side.

Madmouse, yeah the main stream liberal media must be hard up for news.  But also remember what they are saying to each other, "how dare they mock our beloved idol the prez that way".  Well main stream media rear end kissers, IMHO your idol the prez does look like Satan, and just as ugly.  That that and smoke it rear end kissers, oh and wipe the brown circle from your mouths, it is disgusting.

I care more about how accurate this miniseries is, rather than who looks like what.

well, maybe.  just a little.draw on horns, a long tail, just the right light - and a pitchfork..presto!nope, sorry.....

If anyone still doubts the full extant of Obama's EVIL..... cut/paste/google this term: 'President Psycho'...see the photos and blurbs at tomato bubble....CHILLING STUFF!'President Psycho'Great series! Every sunday night at 8. March only!

Which means the left was bored..

Warped best describes some posts here.

Are they saying that all blacks look alike? Racial profiling are we?

The British colonial masters tried to pass  Blue eyed blond hair Jesus all over India back in 18th and 19th century..... Spanish colonial masters successfully passed Spaniard looking  Jesus (with Antonio Banderas hairdo) all over South America

While President Obama may or may not resemble the actor, the actor does not resemble Satan. Satan, before his rebellion, was Lucifer, the angel created and authorized by God with the most splendor and authority. This Lucifer, in his beauty and status looked at himself and became proud, declaring that he will ascend as high, if not higher than God. Also prophesied in the Old Testament, is One who "grew up...like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to Him, nothing in His appearance that we should desire Him." The portrayal in the mini-series, the Bible, has the countenances reversed.  According to human standard, Jesus, in His humanity was unattractive, common, and nondescript, while Satan as Lucifer was majestic and glorious. In Satan's rebellion, he was judged by God on the cross, while Jesus, in His obedience unto death, was resurrected, has ascended, and is now sitting at the right hand of God in all glory.

Who could tell..They all look the same

I think they are one in the same.

Either Obama has a twin in that show, or he has a side job and just got found out

He smells like the devil, acts like a devil, has cursed American like the devil, and looks like the devil... obama has all the attributes of the devil, maybe he really is the devil.Satan is much more eloquent and intelligent than Obongo....He doesnt need a teleprompter

Satan approves of gay marriage also. The resemblence is more than just appearances.

LOL. Did not the Rockafellers have the same problem with a painting?

This is not Obama. Its Satan, Obama's real Father.

Question: What is the difference between Satan and President Obama?Answer:    Satan doesn't need a teleprompter!

Satan black...Jesus white.....a mere coincidence on the Obama thing.....sure

While I have no idea what Satan looks like, I am fairly confident that Samson was not black.

I think we were all pretty much aware that there were similarities between Obama and the Devil before it came out on TV.

The people who see Obama in the "Devil" character need to take a good, long look in the mirror.  THEY'RE the ONLY ones making that connection.  Tells me someone might have some lingering doubts about their Messiah-in-Chief whom they worship so dearly.

Oblamo is the devil, so why not have an actor look like him...Is Satan promising a lot of free stuff too ????

I can't wait for the episode where the "holy ghost" sc(re)ws the already engaged virgin Mary. It would be rather disappointing should they censure the details. This is far better than either "Days of Our Lives" or  "General Hospital". It just seems that they're always leaving out the most salacious and vicious content of the bible.

They even used Teddy Kennedy's corpse to play Noah when he passed out naked and drunk that time.

Harry Reid plays a pillar of salt in this film.

Obama is a big zero.  Sadly, Democrats drank his Kool Aid and think he's a god.

There are many many signs already have been on display:1. Obama's presidential crest fell from the podium.2. A fly landed right in the middle of Obama's forehead3. All the tragedies, natural or man made happening in the country.4. And now the resemblance to Satan...What other signs are people waiting to see so they can connect all the dots?Obama eating grass in the field?

Obama has all the traits of an anti-Christ. He'll schmoooz you at the dinner table all night long and stick a dagger in your back when you turn to leave. He takes the award for being the most two-faced, immature, petty, deceiful, manipulative President in history.

Nothing the liberals can do Obamie has been forever cast as Satan!! It fits.

I don't believe the producers did this on purpose. Rather, it was divine intervention. Many strange events took place during filming of "The Bible". God is warning the USA about who Obama truly is. He's not Satan, He is Satan's emmissary. Obama is EVIL! google:  'President Psycho"

Everyone needs to calm down, including the producers with their "utter nonsense" and "designed as a foolish distraction" comments.  It was a funny observation, you could certainly see a resemblance, we all had a harmless laugh about it, and now it's done.  End of story.If the shoe fits.....

Yes, he does have a resemblance to Satan.

Satan vs Obama...I'll take Obama plus the points !!!

" Pope backs lookalike image of Devil to B. Hussein "...he states, " right on the money "...later prays to God to help America......

its funny... yahoo  bans SATAN  #$%$ cheneys first name

Only you YAHOO LIBERALS would make something of this.........................

WOW..I was watching the show and that's the first thing I said when I saw the character's face..holy sh--, the devil looks just like Obama..LOL..awesome !

I really didn't notice until the comments started.  It bothered me that Satan was pictured as so evil looking.  I thought the Bible described him as beautiful.  What bothers me is that Jesus who was Jewish is always portrayed as a blue eyed, fair skinned guy.  I am enjoying the series though.  Any time I have read a book before I see the movie, I always have at least one character that I have pictured differently.  I don't believe the producers intended to show disrespect to the president.

to coin the phraise of a liberal murderer ,WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE.

You have to admit the Chin,Cheeks,eyes,nose only thing different is a Mole on the chin,and the shape of his eye brows.the rest strait on...Obama as Satan, the only way Republicans could relate and work with Obama...

As I see it, he not looks the part obozo is the satan, also known by a number of other names. On one hand we have the Sons of the Law of one, the Lord thy God,and on the other we have Belial. We have seen him before, A.Hitler, plus many more through out the pages of history.

If satan had a son he would look like Barry

This Bible series is so super condensed that it's not even worth watching.They mumble most of the important stuff and highlight the most well known stuff. It's better to read the bible and get the whole story.

Welcome to the age of stupid !

Well it may not look like Obama, but it sure acted like Obama.

They should not insult satan like that...

"Both Mark and I have nothing but respect and love our president, who is a fellow Christian". Yeah right.

Of course it's utter nonsense. some #$%$ started by a Neanderlib, Just like they raise hell about a white actor playing Jesus. but have np problem with a Jamaican with 3ft long dreadlocks playing Samson.. They have to stir the racial pot.It's what they live for.

Maybe the movie producer did not plan it this way, but maybe god did/1Come on Roma, I know you are trying to keep things civil, but Obama a Christian? I don't believe in Jesus or the Bible and I am more Christian than Obama.

Frankly, I thought he looked more like Rev Wright

Aside from the physical similarity to BHO, I did see the Devil did offer Jesus the ultimate goverment entitlements if He would just vote for him.

The producers knew EXACTLY what they were doing and had a plan all along. They knew there would be drama, and had already planned to vehemently deny it. Genius!

Obama is a devil and a communist spawn

Now it is official, 47% of voters worship Satan.

Clearly Satan would be a better President

When someone mentions Satan it's only natural to think of Obama.

If Satan had a son... would he look like Obama?

Once again, art imitates life.The Head of the Beast - False Prophet - Obama - Who is Muslim and taking the American people to the gates of Hell.

The producers can say whatever they want. Even before this came out, I knew that Obama was related to Satan. Just look at his crazy policies...where did you think he got those crazy Ideas from? Satan himself!!! -----ObamaCare; giving rights to perverted homosexuals; more money for abortion clinics, etc.

I had to look twice to see the resemblence. Much ado about nothing. Belive it or not, there really are more important things to worry about in our country today.

It's a pretty slow week when this stays in the headlines so much.  Folks are way too sensative over silly stuff.

There sure are a lot of black Jews in this version.  Political correctness supersedes accuracy again...

If true, this is pretty offensive... to Satan.

The image from the video has been seen around the world-Obamie as Satan. HAHA  The image is so fitting!!!

People see what they want to see. They believe G.W. was a good president, even when 9/11 happened on his watch, not to mention two wars he started, and the wall street and bank ripoffs losing you home, because you didn't need a down payment. the list goes on.

Obama isn't Satan he's just a ineffective #$%$.

I don't think the casting was on purpose, but it is ironic...The devil is from kenya

satan is going to get all left wing hater's soul, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, aha , ha for ever burn n hell,, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha , ha ha

It worries me that the producers say Obama is a fellow Christian. I'd never, ever make that statement. Get your Berean glasses on, Bible series producers.

Obama is no Christ follower. Check the fruit, it's rotten.

a satan who looks just like showbama,,... oh no!!!

Obummer +satan = ms obummer with bangs

Acts 2:36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ. 37 Now when they heard this, they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Men and brethren, what shall we do? 38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. 39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call.

Thank GOD that he blew himself up in the big bang so he could be omnipresent. We're all made in Gods image (of his God particles).

I thought that before the series "The Bible" came on TV.

Sure, it was all just a random coincidence- no one planned or arranged anything. And just dismissing it makes it all better, right?They're not Christians because they don't do what God's Son Jesus said to do. They're just Bible thumpers making alot of noise. At Matthew 7:21-23 Jesus makes clear that only those doing His FATHERS will inherit the Kingdom.

Well in a couple year's when King Obama has state run TV then he can axe the show but until then just continue to watch and laugh......

I doubt they had any intention of making the guy look like Obama, but if they had, you'd think they'd just say, Yep, we did it, glad you guys caught it LOL

I watched the program onTV, but the Obama-Satan association did not come to mind until I read this on the news.  News people must be bored.

Obama does have a deceptive looking smile and shrug; and he was sure weird and creepy acting when he was campaigning for reelection.

Obama=Satan

seemed like good casting to me

Ha!  We aren't!

Seems like the media and the king paranoid.

Thank GOD that he blew himself up in the big bang so he could be omnipresent.  We're all made in Gods image (of his God particles).This whole obama looking like Satan thing is hysterical. It's type casting to a tee!!!  I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.  Besides, do the liberals have something to fear by this "revelation"???  After all, just about everyone else thinks that obama IS the antichrist and has for the past 6 years.....

It's too late, we know Obama is the devil.

You would think that someone on the editing committee would have raised the question..."hey, doesnt he look like Obama"?and change the face... so, I guess it is Gods plan to expose the lair....

"They can say what they want to..;Obama and Satan are one and the same!""No two separate entities could be that much alike!"

They did not make the DEVIL look like Obama. Obama just happens to look like the DEVIL.

What's the difference?

This is not a racism thing.  Look up the photo and tell me that man doesn't look like Obama.

Just a lucky coincedence that their target audience for this just also happens to be told by their leaders like Rush and Foxx that Obama is the devil. Will wonders never cease?

Ok...does Obama look like Satan or does Satan look like Obama??Answer carefully...it's important!

Even if you don't think he looks like Obama, did no one at the History Channel think it was a bad idea to make Satan black?Satan was going to tell Adam and Eve to have some cake, but Michelle Satan made him offer fruit instead.

Excellent casting choice!!!!!!

looks like it to me,sad part is I think bama is the devil

''Bible' producers dismiss Obama-Satan connection' of course BHO isn't satan, anti-Christ, ahhh maybe !

I'm pretty sure that Satan would drone strike his own people as well.

I have to keep reminding myself we live in 2013 and not in those wild and woolly times of 1513. POTUS looks/is Satan? But, more importantly, were you aware that the devil's proper name is also an anagram for Santa?... Or that Barrack scrambled up is really an insidious "Bra Rack"?The possibilities are endless especially when you've convinced yourself there's a commie lying under your mattress examining that dog eared Penthouse mag you forgot to throw away when the wife moved in and an Machiavellian Marxist hanging around your dreary closet taking diligent notes for the fashionista police. Well i must say, that's where the road forks off for me, literally of course.

A&amp;E Networks is a joint venture of The Walt Disney Co. and Hearst Corp. Remember Micky mouse is also fictional

Lucifer, Satan, Obama...EVIL AXIS.

Ridiculous,some people sure enjoy making a mountain out of a mole hill.It's a movie.

Look out your window there's a scene you would like to catch, the band is playing dixie a man has his hand out streched, it could be the fuhrer or it could be your local priest, sometime Satan comes as a man of Peace.Wow!Is it cold out there!It is so cold this morning, I actually saw a Democrat with his hands in his OWN pocket!

Why not just come out and say it....they depicted satan to look like Obama.....whats the big deal, I on the other hand would have picked Al Sharpton

Cry libs cry, you have satan and a chimp in white house.  Find something to do besides get offended.

The truth is that Obama has an evil heart, what he looks like is not important.

If Obama and the dimocRATS were as worried about the economy as they are about his public image and the welfare of foreign citizens the USA would be in a lot better shape.  Perhaps he can hire a movie czar to profile every movie before the telecast to make sure it's ok. He could also monitor the size of the drink you have, if your snacks are healthy, if your alcohol consumption is limited, and on and on.  Perhaps we will have have someone spoon feed us like they do in the media, give them what we want them to hear, nothing more.

barack hussein and moochelle look just like the poo I flushed !!! Where was the Yahoo news man then ???

The WH has yet to make a statement about Obamie looking like Satan. LOL What can they say??

I noticed they left out the photo of the actor as Satan in this article LOL. Maybe they are trying to downplay Obamie as Satan-it will not work!!! The image has been cast forever-Obamie as the evil Satan.

This image of Obamie will go down in history LOL. There is nothing anyone can do!! Obamie as Satan is deserved.

I thought he looked more like one of the three Kings....for realHe is now where near cunning or smart enough to be Satan.

Just look at all the hate on the bible watchers show. They think Jesus was a republican.

Obama is real, all the rest of it are actors playing characters that represent things that do not exist.

kinda looks like trevons grandfather

Come on Yahoo, show a side by side comparison of the photos.

C'mon, Barack resembles Satan as much as Yahoo resembles a liberal tabloid....mmmm.... bad example....let me get back to you on that.

hey...it's undeniable....both like to divide...

Jesus didn't call Barack...whooops, I mean Satan the Father of all Lies for nothing.

Satian, Vampires, Werwolves, goblins, witchcraft and voodoo are not real things people.  Obama is are current terrable President and our country is in big trouble.  We have real bad problems to worry about, the economy, healthcare, our nationa det, and real problems.  Satian is not going to get you, and Jesus is not going to save you.

I'm sorry Roma, obama is not a christian, I know you're just saying that so you won't recieve any backlash but obama doesn't care for religion because he can't control it. obama doesn't believe in anything bigger than himself. He wants to be the king.he just  look  alike,

Satan find this obama connection to be very offensive

someone should check if Obama has a 666 on his head

Well, if the shoe fits.....

Yea we get it, AP your all about athiesim, the dogma is gettting old, now #$%$ off.

I am pretty sure they attempted to make the resemblance.

Intentional or not, the resemblance IS there and it's funny.

How is it nonsense when their actor does resemble the beast?

Glad to see the liberal media finally listening to Glen Beck. BTW, I thought the Devil looked like a hot version of Nancy Pelosi.

I see a law sue......slowing down! lol!What this nation always had before and seems to be missing now is neither religion or a work ehtic, but good manners, respect and decent education.

As much as I dislike Obama, think he is a fraud, a liar and is ruining America the thought that Satan looks like Obama did not cross my mind. There is a time and place for everything and watching an epic show, the first honest religious show that the History Channel has aired, was not the time nor place for Glen Beck to make the comparison. Give it a rest Beck.

Disgusting to hear Downey felating the marxist-muslim-in-chief and claiming him to be a fellow Christian.  What a fraud!

THE DEVIL HAS TO LOOK LIKE SOMEONE.

You ever DOUBTED????

Actor looks more like the guy who played Caesar on the first season of Rome.

If he was the Devil the REPUBLICANS would be willing to make a deal and co-operate with him.

So what? The media acts like this isn't the first time a president's likeness has been used in movie's before. Get over it.

Just a sad attempt by media types to pigeonhole faith and anything faith based as a right wing political trait. Nonsense.

Are they saying all black folks look alike?politician...satan whats the difference?

May not look alike but they do seem to have a lot in common

He looks way more like a walking turd.

Only the idiotic left is working on this story. Bengazi coverup? What's that?Priorities, priorities.

when the shoe fit,s wear it Obama and follower,s of Anti-Christ

The image of Satan is man-made, so the physical appearance is irrelevant.  But the evils that comes from Satan and from Obama are one and the same.

So why did they choose to portray satan as a black man?

What about the actor?Being called Obama?

Still, Obama looks like satan

I don't. Not by a long shot.I do wish the Pope would have slapped Joe Bidon and told him to wake the "h" up and quit backing the abortion agenda and start practising the faith he claims to embrace

It is like the uproar over the cartoons of the Prophet.

No coincidence at all..... and perfedtly cast.

This is pathetic. All my life I've seen parodies of past presidents and they had a sense of humor about it because they knew it was all in good fun. Now we can't have a bad guy so much as LOOK like Obama even though that wasn't the director's intention? What it this? Mother Russia?

Roma Downey is undoubtably one of the most beautiful ignorant women in television today.

The devil rules America, it sits in the whitehouse and pretends to be our President.

if satan said if he had a son he would look like obozo.....hahahaha

them right wing religious republicans are haveing fun

The "liberal" politicians are a little sensitive about their Master - Obama! Too bad!!

Hypocrites looking for some publicity.  Ignore them &amp; they might go away.A better question is "Why is Jesus not more Semetic looking and why is 'the Devil' a black man in a hoodie?"Just one more, of so many, bad dramatizations.

How about the media move on from this...

I think it's an insult to Satan to suggest Obama looks like him

Christians make me laugh...............

The guy playing the devil looks as much like Obama as an orange looks like an apple. You must be kidding or you must think they all look alike. You cannot be that dumb are you?

What's with all the white guilt?

The only people who think there is a resemblance, who think all black people look the same

i saw the pics and he does look like obummer probably for a reason too

maybe satan is obozo's pastor, rev wright?...you know gd america?

boy...liberals can dish it out but they sure can't take it..huh?...thin skin?If someone does not believe in God why does the devil care? Would he not like you for it? Sounds like the devil is Gods jailer and they are working together.

Fuq Obama and everyone that voted for that monkey.

If Satan had a son, it would look like Treyvon Martin and later in life, Obama.

big ears and all.

He looks more like Pelosi.  Hey!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Both Mark and I have nothing but respect and love our president, who is a fellow Christian,"I think they are liars or insane.

a "white" jesus, of course, don't want to have anything to do with that

Home schooled kids will be told this is actual footage.

Going from the most powerful man in the world, whats next the most powerful man in the universe!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Can't help but think as Obama and Satan as being one in the same...............The DFN needs to grow up.

These prodcers must be really embarrased. They donated to BO'ds reelection. They may have to sit in the back of the room at the next $100,000.00 a plate dinner with the potus.

why do they insult satan by comparing him to obama

I think its hilarious! Obama, the liberal messiah, is finally seen for what he really is.....Satan!  It's poetic justice. LMAO

whatever.....PRODUCERS....non scientific experiment yesterday.  my 19yr old daughter had heard nothing of this.  i asked her to look at the pic and tell me who she thought it was.  "that obama" she said.end of experiment.  if may not be intentional....but it is funnier than fiction, that's for sure.

with apologies to the devil...

Deny all you want History Channel, they similarities are overwhelming.  I LOVE it.  Made my year.

SO.!,  Do you belive what you have seen,or what "THEY" tell you what you have seen??

The liberal media is looking for anything that puts down their Lord and savior President Obama. I still think the devil in the series and President Obama look alike. The devil looks like Obama without his social makeup.

"'Bible' producers dismiss Obama-Satan connection", no, really, what was their first clue!Satan is a Hebrew vocabulary word.  The word was first used when Abraham left the Fertile Crescent and was travelling across modern day Lebonon.  When local people told the tribe to move away the word: opposer, opposition was first used: Satan.

Is it just a coincident that Barack ran our debt up 6.66 trillion?

Oh my gosh, my wife and I saw the resemblance. Kind of comical in an weird way. I am so tired of the mandate of political correctness and over-sensitivity unless it is in persecuting Christians, then you can say whatever you want. It amazes me how much coverage there was of the Pope on all networks, but if you mention Jesus it causes such an uproar! Ridiculous.

Does God look like Grover Norquist?

The left probably thinks they filmed it this way on purpose

audition for this role: look for someone who has played devil a lot and looks just like obama

o bama said hes trayvon martins dad hes wear a hoodie,devil king prezident,michele his ho gangsta rap buys $50,000 dress in NY when 75% americans make $50K N 1 year they dont know how we the people live hes too busy golf with tiger,or fly to hawaii,rich muslim skum

Lighten up, lefties.  You're the same bunch that spent 8 years screeching "Hitler Bush."

The only result of this is Satan is insulted.

I thought the devil was red and had hornsShouldn't the devil be the one who's offended?  Lighten up libs...this is fun

Satan is filing a defamation suit.

If the shoe fits wear it. Personally I would be more insulted that I look like Obummer.

Of course I had to go look it up and it does look just like Obama. lolololol

So what if it was aimed at his resemblance. We have a 1st amendment so fluck off cry baby libterd socialists! What are going to do about it? NOTHING sit down and shut up.

if the shoe fits......

What is really funny is all the good biblical characters are Anglo/euro and the bad characters are black/brown, supposedly biblical stories were mainly covering areas of the Middle east, Iraq/Iran and North Africa.........

I'm sure all the 'critics' know what Satan really looks like. I'm pretty sure they are paid by the great Lucifer.

Of course there's a connection and it's very appropriate.

i am sure that satan takes great offense at being compared to this talking circus monkey,...I think Bill O' Reilly would make the perfect devil.

The truth hurts obama.  He walks like satan, talks like satan and looks like satan, therefore he must be satan.

I think everyone knows that Satan is a black man.

liberals do have similarities with him....(both)

want to know something about liberalism?...look who they really like.....(and hate)

wonder why liberals are on this site?....they think it's a myth anyway.....maybe big bird would be more appropriate ............

just heard on cnn that satan is bringing a lawsuit against the producers for slander....

well, satan does like to divide....

JESUS CHRISTS WORDS? and satan fell like baraq bama CHEW ON THAT SATANIST....

This is a stupid conversation designed to promote hate and bickering.  Ignore it people!had to be a lib to whine about that..first his ears, now this,....

Okay, Satan looks like Obama, George W. Bush's head was on a pike on Game of Thrones, and Glen Beck looks like an over-sized baby that needs a pacifier. Can't we all just get along?

Is it that Obama looks like Satan or that Satan looks like Obama that is the issue?

"Both Mark and I have nothing but respect and love our president, who is a fellow Christian," said Downey...Oh, is he a Christian simply because he attended the church of hate: Jeremiah Wright? Check youtube for some of his sermons.Nice attempt to cover yourselves, but Christian he ain't.

The shoe certainly does fit!!

The guy does look like Obama. Who cares? The actor is just trying to make a living. The president is trying to destroy the country.

Satan is deception. Nothing else needs to be said here.

Sorry but I don't see the resemblance.

People, you got to get a life, elvis is dead and you will not see his face in a loaf of bread......what do you all do all day long, drink drano?  the actors resemblance is just that,,,,,the conspiracy theory behind all this is just that, a load of hooey.....put down the meth and get a job....

Hate to break t to ya folks but Obama is the devil.Look, that Satan looks evil and obama is evil so it is just a coincidence.

This is bad PR for Satan.

It would be much easier for a sane man to associate Satan with those who choose to take from the poor and elderly as opposed to associating Satan with those who choose to protect the poor and elderly. Read Matthew 19, verses 21 - 24.

nothing strikes fear and anger  in a liberal mine than 2 words.....satan and jesus...

If you hate the devil so much why did you overwhelmingly vote him into office.

It doesn't matter to Obama whether you think he resembles the devil in this series. All he cares about is keeping his face in your face. He thrives off attention and this gives it to him no matter what the story line. Its a win win as far as Obama cares.

I hear Dan Ashley of ABC is going to interview Obama, Ha,haha, funny, what is he going to do ask him about his golf game as usual.

I only voted for Obama cause of Michelle, Joe Biden and Rev Wright !!!!

"Evangelical Christians" have been saying Obama was the devil for years. They also say the earth is only 6,000 years old and is as flat as a pancake. Very believable people, they are?

Starting this week he'll look just like Bush.Cheney is the evil satan

Obama has all the attributes of the Antichrist; only time will tell!

The devil made them do it.

sheesh do Obama followers see his face every where ? I have been watching since the begining and I just do not see it ,

HAY MAN BLESS ALL U ALL.

why didn't the get dennis rodman to play JESUS?

People see what THEY want to see.

The Bible producers didn't write the Bible, so who are they to say what is and what is not? Obama sneaks things in just LIKE the devil when we least expect it! He's only fooling himself, because sooner or later, his corruption and bad deeds will catch up to him! I pray it's very soon!!

Don't fear everyone. Jesus has overcome the darkness. We just have to wait until the next election.

hey, Obama, if the horns fit.... He is the devil - only a devil would destroy our wonderful America.Obama is Not a Satan rather Evil.

So, who is the insulted party here? Satan or Obama?

The Devil Charge$ obama only a local call from his obama-phone since he sent usa to hell

I've seen Charleton Heston in Moses face once.

For the viewing public, the correlation between Obama and the devil is so close that when they see one their mind can trick them so that they think they see the other.  As for production, I don't think the producers gave that correlation any thought.

I wont be sure till the actor is seen  playing golf !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Oh my gosh, such a big deal over some stupid actor looking too much like another "stupid actor"...Hollywood and DC are much the same these days, what is a shame is how people have to criticize everything to do with Christianity these days, from we are too zealous in our Faith down to something as silly as to the actor in a film looking too much like Obama and actually loosing touch with what the film was about....It was about the BIBLE, Christianity and NOT about Obama!!!!  He flatters himself way too much.

I'm better looking.

WE the PEOPLE know otherwise.........

They are protected by the First Amendment which allows free speech. Maybe Obama wants to go after both the First AND Second amendments.The hillbillies are out and watching the Bible show, made for the uneducated and gullible.

This is North Korea stuff.  A witch hunt for insulting the Dear Leader...absolutely disgusting.

A spade is a spade

Who cares

the producers needed someone to base their Satan character after...who better than the evil one himself

everyone knows that the devil resembles Romney and Cheney

Satan, Lucifer, Beelzebub, now Barak.

satan is better looking and has more class

huh....can't get a lib to PROVE the bible is a myth....

wonder what the 'mark' GOD  put on cain and his people was?Funny, reading the comments it seems everyone has dismissed this issue as a NON ISSUE except Yahoo and the other lefty liberal media.

to all the liberal women....they think they're both 'smokin' hot....hahah

hey, chavez called w the devil...whats the big deal....obozo sure has thin skin....

hmmm....could it be the liberals see the boogie man and .....hmmmmmm

Satan was the angel of light, the most beautiful angel...the History channel obviously went against that and intentionally cast this character to look like Obama.

nothing strikes a nerve in a liberals heart more than the bible and jesus....wonder why they don't just say oh my donald duck instead of omg?...both are fictious, right?

why do liberals get so bent out of shape?....they say they don't believe in GOD anyway....hmmm......could it be?

The God hating liberals are in desperation mode over the popularity of the show.

He might as well be Satan, this country is going straight to Hell!

I know the face of evil, when I see it. :DIf Obama is so bad, why is Satan trying so hard to bring Obama down?

"The Bible" is based on truth, not fiction, so it makes sense that Satan would look like Obama. The libs didn't have any problem when Samson was portrayed as black !!!!

The better a man is, the more the devil tries to bring him down.

If I voted for Barack does that mean I took the "mark of the Beast"

Respect for a tyrant? an arrogant rude man who thinks hes god,better than we the people caesar declared himself a god &amp; look what happened to him,the Real god will punish this muslim dictator 4 his sins treason 2we the people,N allah we trust1nation under mohamed

Satan show true face

It's hard for some people to understand the idea of picking the best person for the job instead of basing it on an agenda or filling out their affirmative action card.

If anyone should be pictured as Satan it should have been GWB.

Well as far as I am concerned...Obama is doing the work of Satan Helper! he is for all the Wrong things in this Country....Homosexual Agenda...Abortions...Lieing....Being Secretive...he said he be Transparent...you no Syria...and Of Course You Got the Abc..Cbs..Nbc..Cnn..Msnbc..And All their Sister Station Covering Up For Him..Where is the Truth In Obama and the Democrats....The Deception is their Truth...

Satan resides within people, not images.The only reason the Bible series is probably shooing off claims is because I'm sure libtards in Washington would love to axe the series. God is trying to send a wake up call, I'm sure. He isn't going to be patient much longer. I don't blame him!

Guess it is a good distraction from real problems in the country coming from Satan's apprentice, I mean our POTUS

This would be someone’s argument/debate against the series...really???wow.To think of all the garbage that fills the TV airwaves, this series is a pure breath of fresh air!

History channel has portrayed the Devil right - Keeping it accurate and resembling what is running this country now.

Hilarious. It is so obvious a child can understand it. The vast majority of the people who would tune in to see a fictional TV mini-series based on a book - hate Obama - and think he is Satan himself - as well as a Muslim - an Illegal immigrant - and that the Earth is 4000 years old - Jesus rode Dinosaurs - Climate change is a hoax - Cells on their way to a landfill are human beings - and if the Bible said that the sky is really green with purple stripes - then they would believe and/or say that as well I am sure. So TV Producers and Casting Directors are pretty smart - so they hire a black guy who looks like Obama to be Satan - and they take it even a step further - and specifically play on the inherent ( conscious and unconscious ) racism SO prominent in white "Bible thumping" RepubliCon psyches - and they put a "hoodie" on him. I have to say - a pretty smart thing - given the context - the audience demographic - and the motivations to get high ratings.

In the old Star Trek show,Mr. Spock got mistaken for Satan.This is just as silly.

obomais only wants one world government, at the cost of the USA. So he looks PS   " Politically Stupid"

Bill O'Reilly's Divorce Is So Ugly, God Got Involved.  How is He a Good Catholic that he claims to be?

congrats obozo, finally something people can identify you with....

if satan is the 'father' of lies...maybe obozo is the 'nephew'....From the debate on this issue that have seen, I think we need to just fire all white and black actors and actresses and only have Hispanic's play all roles because this country is too racially sensitive and reads too much into everything, especially race.  Just take it out of the equation, most people are too immature.

He IS the devil. So many things he has done in the last 4 years has shown he wants to bring about the end of organized religion , except muslim religion! So yeah, he IS the devil.

You must admit the fact that obama is certainly a tool of Satan

Don’t know what the fuss is all about. Obama’s old lady looks exactly like a member of the cast in “Planet of the Apes”. Their both stars, in the minds of liberals.

&amp; so what if it does resemble obama... what? should the producers be condemned for an accurate depiction.

The entire administration look like devils to me.

I swear the whole thing is just stupid and you would think people would have better things to do then make comparisons..........they really must be  bord with their lives  or have none to begain with.

I bet the actor who played Satan didn't give his resemblance to Obama a second thought. He was probably just happy for the air time and paycheck.

It's EXACTLY what Obama will look like at the end of his second term! LOL

The actor is WORKING. Let him ALONE, already!  The way people are reacting, you'd think the casting call was specifically for a President Obama look-alike.  This will probably boost the ratings for the show.  I know I"M gonna watch itGlen Beck needs to crawl under a rock him and his propaganda,no this guy does not look Obama, but sometime all you need is one tweet and the public wants to take and run with it.Obama and this man no more favor than I would look like Sarah Palin,bunch of foolishness that's what it is,but you have some people that want to promote everything Glen Beck says no matter how foolish it is and believe me he has said some very stupid things,so people don't follow foolishness no matter how much you dislike Obama,I don't really like Obama either,but I don't want to make myself look foolish by following someone elses foolish tweet.

being compared to Obama ?? That's disrespecting Satan

People who are suppose to know their Bible seem to forget, the devil appears as "an angel of light" not an evil harbinger. This is one more example of how OFF this series is.

Bush was Born-Again and we saw what he did. Started a war that killed thousands of people.

Old news, the Apophis villain in Stargate SG-1 looks even more like Obama than this Satan guy.

and I looked an I saw a pale horse and the name upon it was death and Obama followed with it

No picture??

They look exactly alike! Why does the AP have to lie and distort? For whatever reason, these two people look very similar and its interesting.

that is him!! lol

I think he looks like Frank Langella with a tan.Imagine, a tv show putting a president in a bad light, you would never see Satuday Night Live, or the Simpson doing such a thing!!!!

They do look alike!  I'm sure George Bush had something to do with it!!!

First of all, if you religious nutcases knew anything about the bible you'd understand that the one you call Jesus Christ was sent down to Earth to save the Jews first and foremost and the so-called Anti-Christ is the antithesis of that goal.  So since Obama has repeatedly made an effort to help the Jewish Nation of Israel find peace versus those who would see them eliminated then Obama CANNOT and I repeat CANNOT be an Anti-Christ since your own bible says that a house cannot stand against itself.  By the same token, you are doing a disservice to one of your fellow Christians (Obama has openly proclaimed to be a follower of God and Christ therefore according to your scripture he cannot be against Christ- I quote "and Jesus said unto them 'those who are for me cannot be against me') by comparing him to Hitler who tried to eradicate the Jews as opposed to save them (if anything he was an Anti-Christ) and bearing false witness against one of your brethren is a direct violation of one of the ten commandments by the way.  Remove the planks from your own eyes before trying to remove the dust from your brother's.  You hypocrites now stand rebuked!

I personally didn't see much that reminded me of Obama. But I did notice that in the short part and very little dialoge the Devil had a plan, presented it quite well, and then left quietly when it didn't work. None of that reminded me of Obama.Oh yeah, and he didn't go back and blame the people in hell for the failure. Yeah, nothing like Obama.

Okay, they look like they could be twins.  So what?

What's the hardest part about being you?Mustache.

I was going to post the same thing a lot of the readers have already posted about Satan should be offended, but hey, it makes me feel good to know I'm not alone.

unless you're blind

I think he meant that Obama just made thinks worse for Americans since he has been President and things are not looking like there going to well anytime soon. Take a look around and how he portraits  himself. Says one thing does another, he's calm, arrogant, makes apologizes for the U.S. and he's even cutting down on military which we definitlty need. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE???. It always ends up hurting the American people. I think that's what he meant.

I think "W" should have been given the Part of the Angel Gabriel. If the libs had their way, obama would have been Moses parting the Red Sea.everybody knows that satan is republican red not black

Obama is not the devil, but his mother might have been... an underage promiscuous tart, who slept with a married man of a different race and had a child out of wedlock, now THAT is something to worship... and that offspring became president. See, the children of child molesters can succeed.

..curious to see the program..but...based on the photographs,....the resemblance is remarkable.....

I say...if the shoe (face) fits....

A Christian? I doubt Obama is that. The meaning of Christian is a follower of Christ. He don't even believe Christ teachings how can he be a Christian

Put or paint some horns on his pic. Then look.

Satan wishes he were OB. OB doesn't have time for individual souls. That's Holder's job.

Both use lies and deception....no I think he is the devil at least in my mind that is surely what the devil looks like and they both act the same way and being a lawyer is a satanic calling.

Satan can look like any body.

I wouldn't even bother responding, this is nothing more than the Democrats trying to silence a popular Christian message.Any one watching this #$%$ and loving it must be #$%$,remember it's all B.S. Do you really believe in the afterlife? Then I have a deal on the Golden Gate Bridge just for you.

Obama is soooooo nit a Christjan lmao. People he's a Muslim. That comment that he's a Chrjstian is a slap in the facefor those if us that are Christian. Pleassse

No doubt that Barack Obama is the anti Christ.

No matter what I post on here about this issue won't effect what you already believe and I know I can't change that. But yes, obama is NOT right for this country and he kind of does look like the ACTOR playing satan. Just saying...

Gotta be a coincidence - out of philosophical kinship Hollywood would never disrespect a Marxist.

Sounds reasonable to me that the Satan character should resemble Obama.  After all, Obama's character resembles that of Satan!

why do they even think they can make a movie about the bible , and 13 million viewers; this nation is really sad. i didn't watch the movie. anyway who told them how the devil look, they better hope God doesn't allow them to see the devil, his present is hard enough.

Well, it looks like the guy playing the devil looks like he eats better than the big O..  Ahh, the 70's,  I was told I really, really had a good time but, I don't remember.. Not sure if it was the pot, coke or beer..

Everyone already knows satan is in the whitehouse!

Much ado over nothing.lolz!

Guess this is what happens when you won't recognize God at your Dem National Convention!! I don't know why all the hubbub, you Dems don't believe in God so why worry about the devil!!

Why is Christ white and Satan black?

"Fellow Christian" - I don't think so.

Who the hell do these bible thumpers think they are lieing to.

I don't think the Satan character in "The Bible Series" looks like Obama; However, I do believe Obama is one of Satan's diciples. His actions definately aren't those of a Godly person.

Amazing amount of bile coming from a whole lot of pathetic guys...undoubtedly white, who HATE, HATE, HATE our President, because they are failures in their own lives,racists in their hearts, and feeble in their brains! It just KILLS them to see an intelligent, much loved, super successful black man in a position that they can only WISH they were good enough to have!  So they shamefully call him every disgusting name in the book to make themselves feel better.  What sad little men!

Apparently Beck subscribes to the ignorant philosophy that "all blacks look alike" -- the satan character doesn't look anything like Obama.  The fact they used a white guy to portray Jesus just shows how ignorant the history channel has become -- Jesus was an aramaic JEW!

The GOP naturally would recognize satan.....they have been following him for decades

If they would have hired #$%$ Cheney to play Satan, they would have saved in make up and rehearsal.If the shoe fits.................

I do not believe that Obama is Satan, I do believe that he is Satan's right hand man.

obama is worse than satan!

What is this?  a place where sore#$%$ conservatives come to vent their anger with petty name calling and such?     How old are you people?  How do you expect us to vote for your party when you lot are behaving like this?  Isn't your party in the please-and-sorry mode? This isn't gonna help 2016.

GLENN BECK you are the best he look like Obama

How can you possibly miss the connection?  Blowbama is the Anti-Christ, after all...  Like father, like son.

I have thought he was Satan all along!!

"utter nonsense."Only to those with functional brain stems.You freaking losers crack me up............a lot.

just another fairy tale

Obama would laugh, he's above this #$%$. He'll be remembered as a great man long after Glenn Beck is a speck of a footnote of our history of hate.Obama may look like Satan but the Republicans act like the Devil.

I guess some people do see the prez as Satan.

#$%$ Cheney is more the satan type

What they NEED to dismiss is the whole 'bible' altogether, considering it's a book written by mortal men, who didn't even know where rain came from, filled with fairy tales and myths...

Someone clearly made this casting decision with a specific intention.

And once again Yahoo references a story about how something looks and doesn't include a photo.

he does have a resemblance to Obama  just a observation, nothing more....I like and watch the Bible series but it is taking certain liberties..I  seriouslydoubt Sampson was a black man and Sodom and Gomorrah were destroyed because of rampant homosexuality and not because of"corruption" as the series put it. so a little political correctness is in this series.

I love a good fairy tale!

I hadnt even heard of this show before this story broke..publicity stunt ???hmmm

Ha-Satan is not a physical being, nor was he created in Yah's image, so to say he looks like any man is ridicious. He is a cherub. And cherubs are not fat baies with wings. As a matter of fact, whenever an angel made itself physically known to humans, the first thing it would say is "do not fear". They are huge, and Ha-Satan's type is described as a great creature with wings that had eyes all over it.The hollywood mentality of "religion" in the eyes of most people is comical at best.the greatest trick the devil ever pulled on man was making us beleive he does not exist

How else would you get the right wingnuts to tune in?

Every knows that Satan was #$%$ Cheney's pal.

Coincidence my fanny. The actor was chosen for this part specifically because of his appearance, and it was done with malice and forethought.

Looks like OBAMA to me.I thought it was OBAMA in his outher job.

I think that they hit the nail on the head with this one. HE IS SATAN!!

thanks to beck, i have stopped watching this show.  could this be another chews propaganda show???

He does act like him!!!

how many of you "haters" actually even voted? maybe you should make your voices heard at the poles and not the internet!!

I would have guess Anti-Christ but no one likes the moron...These are the same hypocrites who were silent when that CGI-aided film that showed Bush being assasinated came out.

So the producers, who just happen to be right wing christians, put out a cattle call for actors to portray the devil. Of the dozens if not hundreds of actors who auditioned for the part, they just happened to pick somebody who looks like Pres. Obama. If you don't think these people didn't know what they were doing you'll buy anything. There claim might be credible if, and only if, there we not this ongoing obsession by religious zealots since 2008 to portray the Pres as some sort of diabolical figure.

And probably has a Barney Frank character in Sodom &amp; Gemorrah.

The truth be told. The devil is black.    LOL

So why are we surprised.  The producers picked a black man for the devil and a white man for Jesus.  Besides people, the devil is not a man.  The devil or evil lives in everyones mind.  The battle between good and bad is inside.  Nice ploy, lets blame the evil in the world on the black man with a pitch fork in the corner.  No, just look inside and don't let your mind do evil things.  People still take the Bible literally which is why they made the devil a black man in this movie.  We have got to evolve beyond 2,000 year old beliefs.Why didn't they just take it a step further and make Beck or Limbaugh Jesus and Ann Coulter Mother Mary?

If Yahoo posted the picture, you'd be amazed!

If the shoe fits.......

First Hitler, now Satan.   The right has run out of negative images to associate Obama to.

Is it really the producers fault that Obama looks like Satan?  Blame his parents!

I'm sure the reverends jackson and sharpton will weigh in on this one too.can't paint the 1/2 black leper messiah in a bad light, now can weCOULD IT BE SATAN.......WELL ..........

Is it that the actor looks like Obama? or That Obama just happens to look like the devil?I'm just asking

'Bible' producers call Internet chatter that Satan actor resembles Obama 'utter nonsense' because Obama is Satan. HA HA HA HA HA, bow before me.

All the depictions of angels I ever remember seeing were white. In the bible satan was an angel cast out of heaven so he would look like all the other angels. Right?

-obama used the phoenix rising out of the ashes of the old "CHANGE" logo which stands for satan : )- Jesus's Christs words (in hebrew) and satan fell like BARAQ BAMA- obamas name ? RENEGADE= lawlessness and rebellionobama, if you didnt want people believing YOU ARE THE ANTICHRIST AKA SATAN, THEN PERHAPS YOU SHOULD HAVE COME UP WITH A BETTER CAMPAIGN SLOGAN EHHH ? : )

I find it funny that the devil &amp; Obama look so much alike.  Its also strange that its a similarity between the devil &amp; a "black" president.  But whatever it is, I dont like it.  If the devil will be in the Bible again before its all over, it would be much better if they change its look.  This will perhaps be an apology in a sense.  Please take note the producers of the Bible.

The History channel dost protest too much, methinks.

Seek and you shall find! Some people look for anything. As a conservative, I'm sad that Beck can't put politics aside and out of his mind long enough to watch this awesome series. I will pray for his peace of mind- as well as the rest of the people combing cracks for controversies.

I never believe in Bible and religion.......

If the shoe fits!The image of Satan is many.  He is only one of them.

To all Christians...if the character was chosen before Obama was elected then perhaps it isn't a coincidence at all....God works in mysterious ways and is possibly sending a message to beware.  And I find it strange that the producers say Obama is a Christian....that is news to me.  Last I heard Obama has taken out prayer in areas where prayers were performed in the White House.

This discussion is stupid!

Do you believe in coincidences. I didn't think so.

The producers dismisses the idea...I find that too hard to believe.

Satan is humiliated.

I personnelly think some peoples mouths are like a river you cannot stop them from running.  Right, wrong - good, bad - funny, sad, they will always have something negative to say.  I guess we should let the Devil deal with them.

Obam = Satan.....please, let's not insult the Prince of Darkness.

Of course, they would not deny that Obama is in fact the anti-Christ.

This is unfair to Satan.  They must all be satanphobic.  Off to reeducation camps!  Besides I see Judas's face in Obama, along with Alinsky's.At least Satan Governs his empire. Obama keeps campaigning, it's all he knows how to do, poor little tar baby

Let the actor have what is likely a good-paying gig! He can't help how he looks.

obama said he was going to play golf that day, thats him, the real devil in the white house. niger

Great that Yahoo, as always, posted a picture of the actor in question, so we may see for ourselves!

Perfect story for Yahoo. Hits the target audience who would watch and now it will get more ratings.

Does this means Joe Biden is Moses...

Maybe Satan, the deceiver the father of lies look more like Glenn Beck. I have never seen his face but does manifest himself in me an others despite of the commandment to Love God and others as our self. Wonder who he thinks looks like Jesus our Christ and Saviour, I bet he says that he is white with blond hair and blue eyes. I can see the difficulty that lies in telling a biblical story, God Bless and Good Luck.

Really, who cares, just watch the show, and stop making everything about our screwed up govenment, both sides!!!!

Guilty dogs bark first !!!

Satan is also upsetif the bible s a myth, wonder if they put up a display of donald duck and mickey mouse at christmas liberals would demand they take it down?...fairy tales ..right?

We know who the real devil is, and believe me it is not some red dude carrying a pitch fork with two horns in his head, nor is it President Obama.

Same guy.

What sad journalist we have in this country where they would rather focus headlines on this nonesense instead of real issues like the preaident murder American citizens with drone strikes.

One scenario I have investigated: Barry is the false prophet. Pope Francis (friend of Hugo Chavez) is the anti.....   We wait.

This isn't anything like North Korea. They would have shot the people who missed the episode.

Let's see them put a George Bush look alike in the role of Caesar.

Repunks will do everything to smear.

White church goers don't like Obama much.

The producers couldn't get VP Cheney for the role of Satan? Was he already booked?What do you mean? you haven't figured out that President Obama is Crippling our nation financially and his "agenda" is not what he tells the people.Wake Up america of course he is Satan.

I watched the program and did not think the character resembled the president.  However, I am not sure about Downey's claim that the president is a "Christian."

the election of Obama as president has brought out the devil in many white americans ! just read some the comments !

God this is funny. I guess Hitler mustaches weren't good enough for baggers.

I call a spade a spade and if the shoe fits wear it No new taxes for middle,  class check ya pay checks as of 1/7 13. Now $1.2 T in new taxes an $200 B in stimulus. Du devel mades mes dude its. Palin is right, you lie.

Jesus turned water into the Right Whine.

Intentional or not, the fact of the matter is that Barack Obama is Satan.

Why did History show Satan as an older Obama and Jesus as a white European? Everyone knows Jesus was Black!

Glenn Beck would make a better Satan

Do the math. Obama's a Muslim who's ignores America's Christian majority as he pushes through his Pro-Gay, Anti-Christian and Unconstitutional Agenda. Meanwhile 40% of his country can barley feed itself and is living on CHANGE. Yep, he's Satan.The Republican base, the sheep of the Republican organization are so bent on anti Obama brain cloud that they see anti Obama ideas in smoke, puddles and whatever.  This type of following, those without their own spirit would have been a great group of people to have around during the Salem Witch Trials.

everyone knows that the devil resembles Romney

If Obama was the devil the Republicans would deal him.

Glenn Beck is a joke.

I hope all the people making remarks realize that the man playing Satan in this series is an ACTOR and not the real Satan. When will these nuts grow up???

who cares? the bible is fiction

Jesus turned water into the Right Whine.

If the Fu chits wear it Obama. Ahhhhhhhhhhhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!!!!

Glen Beck needs a whack on the head with Cheney's cold, dead pig-heart.

In a related story, Satan, is now being blamed for the current economic woes.After reading the comments posted below I have come to the conclusion:  We the people of America are, when taken as a whole, complete idiots incapable of adult discourse on issues of paramount importance.  Instead we argue over ancient folk tales that we all should have left in our childhoods save for the moral lessons that were supposed to be learned.

I dont recall BHO's supporters being this enraged when he was portrayed with a halo around his head on mag covers, being depicted as their god.

God works in mysterious ways...that may not have been the producers intent, but I don't think it's a co-incidence.

So NOW they actually discovered a rendering of the Fallen Angel, just like in portraits of Jesus Christ the non white man who walked earth 2000 years ago and changed the lives of millions over time? GOOD WORK MASS MEDIA 2 THUMBS UP. Now ppl get OVER IT, itsa MOVIE!!!!

Do a search of Mehdi Quazzani to see his many faces.

You can bet he spends more time on his knees on a rug than he does in front of a cross.

He of the Devil!

I doubt this was coincidental.Religious nuts will take any opportunity to punch at the President.Has anyone seen the real Roma Downey???She looks like Botox and plastic these days.I won't watch this series. Try to avoid TV for the most part.Time for Americans to get off their collective a&amp;&amp;e&amp; and actually do something to help this country instead of hide behind religion and righteousness.To paraphrase Ben Franklin - a thousand hands working can accomplish more than a thousand hands in prayer.

It was serendipity. Just a happy accident.

Looks more like Martin Luther King.6+6+6=18 BarackHusseinObama has 18 letters?

Actually, that was NOT the only black character. Samson was portrayed by a black actor as well. Samson was given to his barren mother (also portrayed by an black actress) as God's champion. People should really watch before commenting. You can't really say "African-American" either as most of the actors on this series are either British or from other countries. There are many cultural backgrounds.There is another actor that looks like Seth Green... so what? The point is, I've seen many black and other cultural actors in positive roles on this show. I've also seen many "white" actors in negative roles. Too much is being made of this. It distracts from very important messages... those of God's word. Jesus, nor the devil have a race.

I should think so.  Same with the "birthers".

GetReal:1:1   Behold world, the ignorant, gullible person that believes without proof, without reason, without logic, shackled to their fears by a emotionally deluded blind religious faith in a nonexistent god. Forgive them for they know not how truly ignorant they are.GetReal 1:2   I say unto you child, allow not your mind to become polluted by superstitious non-sense in order to fulfill an emotional weakness rooted in fear and gullibility.Forsake the ignorance, stupidity, and emotional need in a deluded religious faith that thee might preserve the rational and logical mind. Seek wisdom in reality, in logic, and love all.GetReal 1:3   Child, please open your mind to a bit of reason.Of all the thousands of gods that have been worshiped over the centuries and still many till this very day, that men have shed blood for, died for, and been scarified too, by many different cultures across this planet, were their gods any LESS real to them?  No child, for they also lived a willful delusion.And let us not forget the all the different religions, and all the different beliefs amongst those religions.So I say to you child, open your eyes for there can only be one truth, and that truth falls far from any god but in the realm of reality, reason, logic and critical thinking.GetReal 1:4   Be not afraid to break the shackles child, fear not the threat of an eternity in fire, for it is simply a tool to achieve submission, to scare you, to frighten you to accept the beliefs of your parents, of your culture, to imprison your mind to a supernatural belief, for fear is a powerful weapon, especially when used to corrupt the mind of a defenseless child

As a godless heathen, I could definitely see the connection...

Could it beeeee?

You know what blew this out of proportion?  Glen Beck tweeting it, and conservatives storming the Internet to proclaim that it wasn't a coincidence and that President Obama is indeed Satan.  Don't believe me?  Just read the comments from today or yesterday.  The hatred for this man has gotten past the point of ridiculousness.  A lot of these so-called Christians need to examine themselves, because they are misinterpreting Scripture, displaying a level of vitriol I have never seen, and quite frankly, by saying the things they say about others, not doing God's will.

It's not true. God's word says Satan come to kill, steal and destroy.....mmmmm.... ok.... so killing jobs, stealing money thru taxes and destroying our economy is just a coincidence.

If it looks like a duck, it must be Obama!

LOL  Of course Glenn Beck thinks the dude who looks nothing like Obama thinks he looks exactly like Obama.  The dude has made the most ridiculous associations I have seen in my life.  He is a history revisionist.  Furthermore, the people from the actual movie think he is and his asinine ilk are, "False statements such as these are just designed as a foolish distraction to try and discredit the beauty of the story of the Bible."People, people, people, please. Treat this like the non-story that it is and go about your normal business........ or the President will eat your soul.

How DARE! they insult Satan that way.

There may be physical similarities of Obama to an actor who plays satan.  I'm more interested in similarities in hateful and deceptive deeds to satan.  In that case, there's too many culprits to use a finger to point; a wide paintbrush is even too small.

Whose more offended Satan or Obama?

I truly belive he is satan

If it walks like a duck it must be a duck.

Do you believe in coincidences. I didn't think so.

Even though Amerika is very liberal, there are those of US that recognize that obummer is  "AN" not "THE" anti-christ. Even if the devil on the series "looks" like obummer (he really does) being that the History Channel is Liberal, like most media forms today I'm sure it's not intended. I watched the first part and upon seeing how inaccurate it was, I refused to watch it any further (just like their "NOAH").   Rev. B. Smith

I, for one identified Obama as the biblical anti-christ

Some people have sat in church for the last four years being told that Obama is the Anti-Christ.The GOP naturally would recognize satan.....they have been following him for decades

Another liberal actress who loves Obama.  Really.  Don't care what you say...he still resembles Obama.

Actually Satan was a BEAUTIFUL angelic creature, before he was kicked out of heaven. Onlythe the TRUE students of the BIBLE would know this!  At the very least this garbage is onlyspread by POLITICANS and ANTI-CHRISTIANS! I rest my case. Wake up people get yourheads from out of your arm pits!

People i guess have their own image of what the devil should look like... Let me know when someone has a real idea on this! Next!

The Bible story: YES. The devil looks like or resembles Pres. Obama.. Tivo it , go back and forth if you have recorded the Bible, judge for yourself. I was taking in that scene and it was uncanny. We can chatter, twitter, talk about it ..judge for yourself. And so what? ..."devil is in the details...in Washington DC.. anyone's guess who is more devilish..there..right??? I mean, wasn't that Pres. Bill Clinton a little devil??? his own words as he swore, "I never had sex with that woman" and seriously??? Bill Clinton makes plenty of dough around the world and vouches at DNC for Pres. Obama, so be it... no, you aren't fooled are you America?? right.

People are always looking for a controversy... so annoying!

I look like God. lol People look for a story in everything.

Obama is the devil, he is ruining this country on purpose.......what other explanation could there be?????

This documentary is great. I love it as an Atheist. It shows how incredibly stupid fundamentalist Christians are....I can see where those who believe in metaphors can make a case...by strict fundamentalism is utter nonsense.

This Bible series is more like a SCREEN TEST.  CECIL B. DIMILLE IS STILL THE KING OF MAKING BIBLE STORY MOVIES.Look alike? All I know is that Obama's policies are sending us to #$%^ in a hand-basket!!

I wonder what President Obama thinks about all of this. I bet any day now he will give a news conference about this.

Yes there is a story like that and the man was George Bush!!!

Hey I'm loving "The Bible" but I think we all know that he looks like Obama

Why does anyone take Glen Beck serious anymore anyways? Glen Beck is a fool of a nutcase and should be locked up somewhere to get put on serious mental health medications or give the man a lobotomy for petes sake.

I agree 100% with the producers!!! Only I'd call it total BS! I use to like Glenn Beck, but have come to view him as an INSTIGATOR and media-hound...who is losing the spotlight, so is grasping at straws for ANY reaction however small! Or however slanderous it is, to the other parties ie; the actor featured. Glenn-stick to what you know best, salacious gossiping and instigating against innocent people doesn't suit you well....nor should it! Sheesh!

this is great

Other than the actor playing Satan having dark skin, I saw no real resemblance.

Oh well, we are already missing jesus-reality connection.

Insert McCain: "no mam, he's a fine decent, family man."if it looks like a duck, quacks like a duck...

It is utter nonsense for sure.

I saw the image of the Satan they portrayed in the "Bible" as I watched the 2 hr. show. As I said in an earlier post, people see what THEY want to see. It was a depiction, nothing more.

Democrats are making themselves look bad by concentrating on this non news. And Glenn Beck is no better. Sick of you all and your mindless partisan ranting.

I guess the media would have done the same to Jesus if they had been around during his time.Does no one of you remember the story of Jesus's trial, where the public were asked who to set free, Barabas or Jesus.I would imagine that this trial would have followed a year or so slander at the hands of the corrupt Pharisees and other corrupt businessmen/people, who were threatened by Jesus's new righteous and just system, especially as the main emphasis of Jesus's campaign was to take away the Pharisees completely, removing their power as the conduit between the people and God, so that the people no longer had to offer money and sacrifices to the Pharisees, but could simply prey through Jesus Christ, Jesus being the Ransom Sacrifice that replaces the Pharisees state.

Look up the meaning of the name "Obama" on a baby names website.  It is pretty friggin hilarious!  Obama means "crooked".  LOL.  Adding the comparison that is included in this article with the definition of his name really makes me laugh!  Oh, the irony. Can we say, "Here's your sign"?  :P

Unless you are totally blind and brain dead the man does look like Obama! The flip side is  he is not Obama. If this had been a George Bush look alike. CNN and Hard Ball with Chris Matthew would be having a field day for weeks as well as the morning talk shows laughing a having a grand ole time but since ABC NCB and CNN are Obama surrogates they are #$%$ and moaning like their God had been insulted.

Utter nonsense that they look alike or that they planned it that way? You can't deny that it looks like him. Looks like a before and after photo of every President we've had.They sure do age drastically.

Cain you made up a Devil with Bono for every one..what did you ugly little souls expect..I told bono when he was bringing hell to earth for every one but yourselve's ..that that was what you would be looking at..and sure enough  Falling Sky's..all the men you ignorent little souls turned into monsters...I am the Devil my Crown is Called the Crimson crown and you boys are insuring this for yourselve's...you know me Cain..you know i dont #$%$ around..you know...and you will wait eternity...I warned you all...Catch the Spit..because if i have to destroy all souls to get to you #$%$ ..I will

If they would have played this series four and a half years ago we would be having this discussion.....Who is this guy Benn Gleck?

Had really glen beck heard and understood the word " PATRIOTIC"?? That's trully bad  when a commentator is that mach santanically !

What an insult to Satan. I bet he's #$%$ as the devil now!

Should have used a Cheney look alike and it would have come closer to the truth.

They both are FUGLY!

Oblama supporters will find EVERYTHING &amp; ANYTHING they can to make everyone else on the planet look bad. these people are sick and nothing but a bunch of non working idiots

Well, the truth has came out. Where is Glen beck now? In hiding I bet.

They can't help the resemblance, after all, Obama promised "the most transparent administration"!

Speaking of someone looking like Satan: G.W. Bush with horns is a split image of the devil I have seen.

Shame on Beck.just so everyone can know, my post is neither for or against Obama,it is against Beck and his sometime stupidity.

This media outrage and the response from and to the WH is no different than fearing the radical islamists because of a cartoon of Mohammed. Watch out for a White House "Fatwah" against the History Channel! They'll need to join Salman Rushdie in hiding.

I think it was a Freudian slip.  Deep in their psyche's they equate Obama with evil and deceit.  Most people just openly admit it.

I guess Obama is really a Moroccan National.

It would be unfair to say that Obama is Satan.  Son maybe, tool certainly, but not Satan himself.

Does anyone understand "scotoma"? A blind spot in vision, often leading to unintentional associations. We humans have to make sense of our world, so we associate what we think we know when we are confronted by something new.  Also, I thought the actor might be Frank Langella - a marvelous actor!

if this all that the NAY-SAYERS viewed.  then they missed the point of the Series!AMEN!

The funny thing is, this complaint supposedly came from the Republicans!!!

I thought he looked like him too. But unless they changed the guys face with  graphic alterations- he was just an actor who happened to look him Mr. President :)

Regardless of who the character looks like, the thing that disappoints me is that we have supposedly educated people who think Satan actually comes in a human form and looks like anybody at all.I do think it is interesting that the producers made Satan a man of color (which he could be I suppose) and Christ in the movie is a white man, which he almost certainly wasn't. Historic accuracy is not a factor in movie making I understand.

Bubble is sure funny.

Love it.

Initially I thought that "The Bible" was backed by right-wing wackos, and that (like Glenn Beck) they were of such low character that they'd intentionally cast an actor as Satan who bears a passing resemblance to our first African-American president.  However, their denials in this regard, including Ms. Downey acknowledging that Mr. Obama is a fellow Christian, reassures me.  This doesn't change the fact that I cut off cable six years ago, so won't be seeing "The Bible" in any case.  Their casting of a male fashion model as "Jesus" was a hoot, though.

If Pres Obama looks like anyone it's Frank Marshall Davis....

If the people criticizing the Bible story would watch the whole show, they would see that there is a black angle and Samson is black.  They only look for the negative when it comes to the Bible.

Obama is Satan weather you like it or not

Feeble minded people need fairy tales to justify their behavior and a promise of some sort of eternal reward for being decent human beings!

Amen Dizzy. God bless you for speaking up. I am so blessed that for once there is a show in Tv that is glorifying God , The true God of Israel . This is not about Obama or anyone else, let's not allow the devil to bring distraction. God Bless you Mark Burnett and Roma Downey for making this series. May the Lord continue using it for His glory and His name be lifted on Hight.

i seen one show,did any one of them really read the book.there was a lot missing from the show,rewriting the bible,must be hard workI have never been a religious person so I thought I would try to watch the movie on the History channel about the Bible.  It is to violent.  Every other scene is someone losing their head or being slaughtered.  Sorry, that is not entertaining to me.....so much for trying.

The frustration + anger still oozes from every comment of the numerous Obama haters who can't find a rational way to criticize him. You all sound like Palin at CPAC, so I have to assume the same level of intelligence.

So every time this well known actor takes any ominous role, these yap first, incomprehensibly ignorant people who who don't check to see who he is first, are going to yell foul that the president is being picked on.  In this case I would be surprised if the president didn't find this one humorous and yet stupid.

It's interesting considering the fact that Obama actually fits the biblical description of Jesus ...  Bronze skin and hair of lambs wool.  Maybe that means that satan is the one with long flowing hair and blue eyes.

Just like Bill O'Really the, proud patriot, proud American Catholic, proud advocate of "traditional" marriage is coming out of a nasty, divorce, you will also see the real Glenn Beck or I should say Glenda Wreck very soon. Don't let that holier than thou front fool you. Including Rash Limbo (the drug lord) and Yawn Insanity(the loud mouth) they are all pigs and bigots.

All it takes to spread dis-information , hatred and bigotry is a bigmouth like Beck. It's really sad when people cannot see their own hatred and try to justify it through media and pretending to be a disciple of Christ.

Actually...according to the Bible, Satan was a cherubim and was a very beautiful creature to look upon.  I highly doubt he looked like this or had horns and pitchfork.  The devil presents himself as an angel of light...people wouldn't fall for his tricks if he looked like this.  Everything is sugar coated by the devil.

That's scary that they selected him before Obama was elected president.

First of all, no one knows what the devil looks like. But the producers of the Bible series knew that this particular actor resembled Obama when they hired him. They are lying when they say otherwise.  And when you are trying to tell and sell stories in the Bible it's best not to lie. He (God) is watching!

Didn't many of you same goobers #$%$ yourselves with rage when the "Game of Thrones" Bush head on a stick thing happened. Who cares in either case, I'm sure the only two who would laugh about it are G'Dumbs and Obama. I bet he (BO) even jokes about it soon at a press briefing.It WAS intentional!

Of course it's not Obama or supposed to look like him as everyone knows #$%$ Cheney is the actual devil.

Obama only resembles Satan spiritually

Jesus the greatest magician of all time

would you all stop disrespecting the president! no matter who is the presicent of these united states, that perseon deserves respect!  if you all can do a better job as president, then by all means run for office!

Too many brain dead fox news repoters like glenn Beck,, Still would like to know how he and fox news knew about that Attack in Libia before it happen!!!!

Satan is "Jesus's" most glorified creature, I doubt he looks like obama, lol, not that there is any thing wrong with thatl. lol

Let me see...Super religious and conservative producer and a liberal president who is cool with things like gay marraige. This is not just a coincidence. And they love Obama.....right.

But Glen Beck said that Satan looked like Obama and like everything he puts on his chalkboard like the conspiracy to make the USA a godless, socialist state by liberals and that even G W Bush is involved in this socialist takeover... why as a good conservative... you gotta go with the real evidence.... and thats what Rush and Hannity and Glen say - I mean you can't believe the MSM... only these god-fearing patriots.

A&amp;E sure knows how to get ratings.....Immature conservatives probably are just eating this up.  Ignorant twits.  But if the actor resembled one of their right wing dieties, they would cry and scream, pathetic.    I see a bigger issue, why is it, that in every religious show, the middle east back in ancient times is swarming with european looking individuals? Really guys, way to whitewash your religion and ignore anthropological research.  Fiction depicted in fiction, I suppose...still do not understand why this is on History channel, Scifi maybe.

What financial religious institutions are these producers associated with? If they are flat earthers, then yes, this was done intentionally.

Yeah, right!

Yeah, that stupid Jesus have been contemptibly rubbish and that Negr0 president is more a contemptible obnoxious slave than Jesus' enemy.

-._- its still sad to me how disgusting people can be towards someone they dont even know personally. WHy do people always classify each other based on their views.. "The Liberal, The Republican" come on people its 2013 lets try to EVOLVE as a country instead of Trying to get mad at each other for thinking slightly different... Homestly theyre both one in the same except really How things should be handled... Come on USA lets do better

Hey, wait... YOU kinda look like Jerry Sandusky!!!!!

I'm so happy that Mark Burnett that he's directing The Bible miniseries! I could care less if satan looks like Obama, there's should and must be a deeper effect to these miniseries!

BARRY SOETORO OBAMA is the end-times ANTICHRIST in the book of Revelation (see chapter 13).Satan character resemblance of ILLEGAL president barry soetoro obama a "utter nonsense?" Only if you have no ears to hear nor eyes to see.satan IS obama's father.

What does Satan really look like......as well as God, what is His/Her image?  If these images come in the form of corruption and greed and the duality of love  and compassion, those images are reveal to us on a daily basis.  Move on from the old conception of "What is" into a sense of non-judgment of others and ignorant thought.

Glenn Beck is a devil everybody knws that .everybody also knw that he is a cronic hater of peace.You mean this is wrong...as opposed to a black (African) Samson?  (According to the Bible...an Israelite, a Mediterranean/Semitic race...)

Obama is not the devil, but he is a son of the devil.

If any, they should have depicted Satan like the true Fallen Angel, an Aryan ideal angelic face with cynicism, suffering and hate on his face. That is who Satan originally was: the Morning Star.

They offered the part to Obama, but he was on vacation....:)

And what kind of christian condons same sex marriage. Now before I get my head bit off you guys go ahead a marry who you want I as a follower of Jesus just think it's wrong. Sorry if I got off the topic

666

Still Funny.

Yea right that's him.

Just like the neo-evangelical nutters dismissed the 'left behind' video game's resemblance of Satan to the Pope and Satan's army to the UN peacekeepers.  Methinks they doth protest too much.

Only a right-winged Con whose party is beginning to be synonymous with losing would squeal with delight that someone came up with such a childish and ignorant comparison of the Nation's President.  But the country has come to expect that from them.  Keep perpetuating that "ignorant" label.You really need to take Bobby Jinda's advice and: "stop being the stupid party"It seems every minute of every day, Someone has to find Something to be Offended/Shocked about. Whether it's real or imagined, they think it's a good way to say look at me, hear me rant.

So what?  Paranoid? Get a life

I learned in bible studies that SATAN IS A BEAUTIFUL BLOND HAIR, BLUE EYED ARCH-ANGEL who tried to dethrone the LORD, lost the battle and was CAST OUT OF HEAVEN.  So how and when did OUR PRESIDENTS PHYSICAL APPEARANCE CHANGE?

This proves to me the stupidity of American People.  This is a actor some guy cast to play Satan, not the real Satan folks.

everyone knows that the devil resembles Romney and cheney

For now.

Obama is gonna be so happy when his term is over with. HOw stupid can you get? What this family has been thru since he got into the office. Nobody says a nice word about him. It is all racism and jealous. The man is brilliant and he was left a nightmare, who would want his job?The republicans are a freakin' joke, they want to get rid of pension plans, Soc SEc, Unions, Medicare...the repbulicans care about no one except the rich. The rich don't need health insursance. IF you have 40 million in the bank, you just pay the bill. $600 a month for ins isn't no big deal.  Poor, working class people voting for a republican is like a chicken voting for Colonel Sanders. The beginning of the end was Ronald Reagan. He started it all by lowering the tax on the rich and getting rid of the unions. Thanks Ron. Yeah, right and Obama is Satan and he was born in Africa.......right...whatever. STupidity....America has gone brain dead folks.

As they should, but people with reprobate minds will still blame them

A more accurate depiction would one where satan looks like #$%$ Cheney.

I don't see the resemblance at all- only that The Bible Satan has a darker complexion.  I can't believe the trite things people are concerned with lately.  Let it go people and take a walk.Trust me, satan is more subtle than what is obvious...the real one and his entrouge has got millions fooled already.   source-the bible

Obama isn't Satan! Everyone knows he's the son of Satan :)

Obama only wishes they would have asked him to do the acting.  The wanna be celebrity!

So sad to see so much hate in the world coming from people who think they know God.If you know your Bible you know that satan does not decend from the United State s

This guy is going to be in demand, Leno, Letterman, SNL, maybe some Vatican appearences.

This is too funny!

It's cute - just like when Hugo Chavez said the UN chamber still smelled like sulfur the day after President Bush spoke there.  Real funny, right.

Obama is a great president.!!!!

I wasn't going to reply to this as it is an absolute piece of foolishness - imagine this making headlines. As the old song says,"Anything Goes!"

if Jesus was here today ..glen ..pecker head.. beck would want to see his birth certificate before he would believe..pecker head is a birther and a teabagger.. and his kool-aid sheep believe all his lies..owebama's look alike.....

Obama is Jesus X10.  He is the one true king.   Praise Him.

Well it looks like the Beckers are here. A stupid non-news story from conservatives and you still blame Obama. Amazing!

You can't blame the producers for something that God arranged!

i mean,  what else did you expect them to say?   yeah, we did it?  LOL

If the shoe fits....

And I look like Halle Berry...don't really see way the problem is.....lol

At times I question the loyalty and respect of the citizens of this country. For one to even connect the President of this country or any other country as Satan the Devil has a lot to think about their respect to the people and leaders that represent this country. We need to follow our grand example Jesus when he showed respect to the local governments but remained neutral. He knew that the governments were controlled by Satan the Devil; but never connected any of the world leaders of his time to be like Satan. In Luke 4:5-8 it reads that the Devil showed Jesus “all the kingdoms (governments) of the…earth” and said: “I will give you all this authority and the glory of them, because it has been delivered to me, and to whomever I wish I give it.” This is where Satan tempted Jesus to “do an act of worship before me (Satan), (and) it will all be yours (governments).” This is proof that the governments of today are still under Satan’s control since Jesus remained faithful to his Father Jehovah on that day. The current world leaders too have an opportunity to change their lives and confide in God’s kingdom, just like Jesus taught us to pray for in Matthew 6:9, 10. It is time for the people to seek for Jehovah God’s kingdom and refrain from man’s government that has been unsuccessful. If we analyze all of the world’s problems it indicates that the one controlling it is Satan the Devil, and not God.

Well you know they all look alike, so it could be just a mistake! Barak Husatan Obama..

Jesus was NEVER blond and blue eyed but the devil probably was-the producers KNEW what they were doing just feeding into the far right Christian frenzy against Obama-SHAME ON THEMLooks like Glenn Beck+++++++++++++

Why is this news?In every episode of Law and Order, the evil bad guy is a rich white male. Becasue "The Bible" shows something a lot closer to the truth, all the liberals are up in arms. More selective outrage from the looney left.

Just don't forget America, the History Channel is OWNED lock stock and barrel by FOX NETWORK ulterior motive, maybe just maybe, you THINK huh  HUH????

I don't like Obama,  but this is too much.. you guys are evils or devils not Obama.

Oh wow, this the price for freedom of speech, I take it? You Americans are a pampered lot. It would be educating if you took time off to check out countries where you can be jailed for a much lesser insult. Stocks will be too mild a punishment. I hope your President's family has developed a thicker armour. Sad.

What did expect from " entertainment made for for Americas Bible thumping rednecks"

Silly A&amp;E, the Bible is not history; It's mythology.

And all the Fox &amp; Frightwing radio freaks emerge from the shadows.

Who cares the bible is mostly fiction anyways

Hide behind jesus with your hate of a black man who's the prez GOPLong live Obama! Why do so many people making comments here hate Obama? Because he is trying to correct the USA, religions and the world. My best leaders of the world have been Reagan, Gorbacheve and Obama.

Beck is trying to hid the fact that he himself is the saten. And one hect of a stupid one!

watched the series night and what the devil does not look like obama. that is the dumbest thing i have ever heard! it,s an excuse to attack the bible. it,s uncalled for!

Well, Roma Downey just lost my respect when she said she loves our president, a fellow Christian!!

Not one of their best ideas, having a white actor playing Jesus, and a black one playing the Devil, especially when considering the area and nationality that Jesus grew up in, and was, he would most likely have been very dark skinned.And then even more humerously, they have him wearing a "hoodie"?Someone was sure NOT thinking on this one.

I think he looks like my dogs behind, Fido dosen't mind

satan lives at 1600 pennsylvania ave washington dc. and is leading our country into hell

Obama is Satan...and Satan is a pile of feces...

How fitting.

Hollyweird doesn't make mistakes with their castings.  Controversy is good for sales.Some people have nothing better to do than create problems where there are none.  If you really have that much time on your hands I have a few things that need doing around my house.  How about giving us a hand?  It will keep you out of trouble.

No one on the face of this earth looks more like satan then #$%$ Cheney...........

Satan does not exist. Lust for power and money comes from the human condition, as much as evil in all forms.

People who think the producers deliberately cast an actor who resembles Obama to play Satan will find further ammunition in the DVD edition of the series.  Some of Satan's lines in the deleted scenes are:"You didn't build that manger, Jesus!""Submit to me, Jesus, and I will make you ruler of all the 57 tribes of Israel!""You think I look scary? Wait 'til you see my wife!"

Ha ha..Obama has always wanted to be a celebrity..maybe he is the antichrist ??

do you want to know who's the "devil"?? on this day looking back 10 years ago, here's the list:GW Bush, D Cheney, D Rumsfeld, P Wolfowitz......It is not only Iraq that suffered it is USA still paying and suffering.....

Glen Beck  needs help

Obama's real father??

Critics from the delusional liberal left will always find something "offensive" about their boy in the White House. Any ridicule, criticism or other negative comments (such as how he lied to us about ObamaCare) is therefore (in the words of Adolf Hitler) "verbotten!"

Satan is offended because the comparison, though comical, does hint at an allegiance between he and the President.  The Deceiver doesn’t want anyone to realize that his puppet is doing his bidding.  We, nonetheless, already knew about their alliance.  We know as well about the allegiance liberal media moguls have with Obama.  The media’s deference toward liberal candidates has been palpable since Clinton’s first campaign for the Presidency.  But until Barak Hussein Obama first claimed “no conflict” between Faith and the Democrat’s platform I would not have believed anyone had the gall to boldly proclaim a lie of that magnitude!  I think it was at that moment that “the prince of the power of the air” pulled-out the stops.  Now it is as though those in control of media outlets don't even pretend to present both sides.  (Ephesians 2:1-3)  If their trend toward unfettered manipulation of the facts and public opinion is not exposed and stopped, we may well be seeing America's undoing.  There is nothing comical about that.OMG! It's true! As a Christian Democrat I'm going to cancel my order for the DVD. That's just terrible. What were they thinking disrespecting the President like that! Shocking!

Anyone who thinks the producers protest too much raise your hand. The are many people involved in the screening process of hiring talent - especially a major character - and I refuse to believe no one raised a concern about this actor's resemblance to our President. If I didn't know better it would appear as if President Obama is moonlighting. What they should have answered is "why of course he looks like the President...he is our main sign of the end of days, someone of color should NEVER lead a country" UGH

A lot of people sitting in "Church" have a rude awakening... Its more like a Country Club (members Only). And excuse me Sunday is the most segregated day of the week.. I have been to many churches and God was gone a long time ago.. It’s become a place to go to impress each other ridicule sinner’s and judge people while spouting hate in the “Name of Jesus”... it’s sickening!!

Awesome series! I think it was smart of them to cast an Obama look-alike through. Controversy for the next ten years if nothing else to get the series out there. It may not be why they casted him, I am sure he is an amazing actor. But definately a plus for the History Channel. BTW, I am a History Channel junkie.

Where I see satan is in the faces of people who are hate filled... Read on...

This is a stupid story!

I'm enjoying reading all of the fine examples of liberal tolerance and love on here.  I'm getting a tingle up my leg.

I thought he looked like Bush Cheney,,then morfed into Romney for a bit, if you look carefully from the left its totally and actually Rick Satantorum

well this is what happens when you depicts the bad guy as black, and the white man as good been going on since way back when agnels are always white and the devil is always black i'll take the devil

If you call yourself a Christian and belief Obama looks like the Devil.  It proves the religeon is for idiots only.utter nonsense that just about everyone associated their satan with our president?that's nonsense whether you like him or not

Impossible Satan is White, ask any indigenous tribe in the world Who destroyed their people?

Get over it he's the President and all your hatred and redirect and misplaced hate wont change a thing.

From a production point of view, good producers and casting crew are sensitive to race and gender.  It is offensive that 'Satan' is Black. Conversely, numerous characters on the  rightous side, are far whiter than a Mederranian hertigage would have been. The producers and casting of this series should be ashamed of this protrayal and in this subject matter should have been far more sensitive.

If anyone would know what Satan looked like it would be Glen Beck , that's for sure .Satan has got his number.

“With or without religion, you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.” ~ Steven Weinberg, Nobel prize winning physicist.

Obama has tried to introduce health care for all, help the poor. That seems like the actions of a Christian. The Neo cons want to cut all help to the poor and only give health care if you can pay. Who needs Satan when we have are own devils.

they knew what they did disrespect the President USA

You all are just mad because he is running America and in charge of running you, get over it he is staying. Lol. Ha ha Ha

It's not nonsense!!I thank God everyday that Obama is our President.republicans have long proven that they cannot discern movies from real life.

Its a mini series based on a book of fairy tales? How can anyone take this seriously??

And, NO, Obama is NOT the anti-christ!!!!!!

After reading "comments"from infantile Yahoo users,you can only conclude the Yahoo homepages attract REPUKES and TEABAGGERS in disproportionate numbers!

It's apparent from the majority of these homophobic, racist and anti-semitic comments that the Bible, esp. the New Testament,  really isn't the book for you fools.   I think "Mein Kampf" is much more suited to your angy, poorly-pleasured alleys.

I have been watching this movie and Obama bears NO resemblance to the man who plays Satan.  Whoever started this story is crazy.  And as for the afterlife, Mr. Obama, as the rest of us, will stand alone to be judged.  I would hate to think of the judgement for someone who has double-downed on killing of the unborn.

I was always mistaken for a greek god for my super muscular physique on the other hand. And was begged to play the role of Don Juan de Marco before my fan played it. It made them envious of me because of super hot and sexy supermodels lining up to the gates of my luxurious mansion to apply as my personal maid among hundreds of these glamorously hot women that i already accepted.Hell yeah!!!! Raise the roof!!!!

Okay, enough.  The actor is very convincing in his role - I guess.  I say that only because I cannot watch this Hollywood Uber Drama - no matter what the "Producers" say...it's WAY TOO  full of violence and now this kind of stupidity is connected to the mini-series or whatever it is.  I am a Christian, read my Bible constantly - and simply cannot watch this run of fighting and horrible treatment of human beings on our television, because it induces nightmares.  I do not agree that their goal is to reach "people who have never read the Bible via their Hollywood efforts at violence and big hoopla and fighting in order to capture this audience - nothing could be more insulting.

Did anyone notice that Osama Bin Laden looked like Jesus Christ ,and we all know that wasn't true!!! Why don't you people leave Obama alone !!!

Obama a fallen Angel?The character looked like Spock.FOCUS...........Syria is using CHEMICALS.Is making sure every American gets healthcare something Satan would do?

I guess there was no other black people during biblical times except the devil.  Thanks His-story channel.

Obama is the   MODERN DAY CHRIST, being crucified by the SAME TYPES that crucified JESUS!! Get the sh.t out of your heads you ignorant monkies!!

The History Channel is a branch of the Christian Right, which is a branch of the GOP, which is a branch of the 1%.  The resemblance is hardly a coincidence.

Its amazing how "most" ppl think every race look alike. And depending on where they're from. They do ressemble one another. I think the ppl involved with the show "Bible" put that Obama look out to get ppl to watch the show. I tried to watch the show last night and was bored into a coma.

If a movie has a random African man in it and you see Obama, then who is the racist?

It is not 'utter nonsense', the actor, whether deliberately or by chance, resembles and aged Obama.  To say it is 'utter nonsense' is to admit guilt.   Never watching any more of Mark Burnett's telegarbage again.

Satan, a fictional character made up by man, no different then fictional characters like Frankenstein Wolf man or talking snakes. Religion what a joke, people are so insecure.

David Letterman had it right...if Obama were indeed the devil, the Republicans would have no qualms about making deals with him.

just another Christian fairy-tale. it's amazing how many nuts are in this country. the bible is just a well written book. the so called events are happening because the nuts are making it happen. nothing mysterious about it. these nit cases are buying guns left and right. when they start shooting each other the first thing they will say is "it was in the bible" the bible, just like most religions, is the problem. get rid of the bible, respect and love each other is the answer. most people in this planet die over religious beliefs than any thing. what's difference between a cripand blood war and war between Christians and Muslims? Nothing.GOP = SATANS CLUB

So folks...who died and left you all in charge to speak for GOD!!??? Who in 'hell' knows what the devil looks like???....Furthermore,  I did not know the devil was a human being.....then again...he is known to be deceitful...sorta like the Native American's view of the man with fork tongue!!

I wish that O'Bama were Satan.. Then he could send all that Christian Trash to Hell already...!!!!

Is it so hard to except defeat? We won and you got your little Satin butts handed to you. If you are really Christians you suppose to pray for the president not wish him harm, because GOD is in control and nothing happen without his authority. You hypocrites!!!!

Yep,it was pretty blatant that they were trying to make Satan look like Obama! When I was watching the show my jaw dropped when he was revealed! I was like, OH #$%$,Tade the Devil look like Obama!! And then laughed hysterically!Idiots!

Why do we still live  in a time were stupid people with little minds act and stay the things thay say,grow up

Satan is far less cruel and murderous than God.

haven't watch the show and probably won't waste my time but this was funny. Obama a Christian? bunch of BS. But Obama was put in office by God. Read it yourself in the Bible: Romans 13:1 "Everyone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God."  yep, even Hitler was allowed to have power but when a leader opposes God's law then we are to obey God and not man. Acts 5:29 “We must obey God rather than men." Oppose Obama people. He is not obeying God's law.

OBAMA is PRESIDENT!!  DEAL with it you CLOWNS!!

Oh, well....I know plenty of people who would love to tell him to go to hell!Nobody can dismiss the Obama-Satan connection!!!!

Obama is the devil so I don't know what the problem is.   I'm sure Mitt Romney is playing Jesus right?

Oh Glenn, please shut up!

this must be another attack from the liberals on Christianity??? doesn't everyone see obama as satan

Blonde hair blue eyed Jesus and Obama looking Satan...*chuckle* when in reality, Jesus most likely looked more like Obama than that guy Michaelangelo made him out to look like which fooled generations for milennia!

Hey hate filled Republicans look in the mirror if you want to see Satan!

Oh, and a lot of this is based off a tweet by Glenn Beck?    That's sad but predictable.....and has Palin weighed in on it yet?    No story is complete without her input.

Im scared that glenn beck has as much influence as he does,if we ignore him he might go away

They did us all a disservice by not having it look like #$%$ Cheney, the real Satan. Then again, he's as ugly as a toad, so they couldn't use him in primetime.

How could a President who stands up for love and equality and only the good of all people be called evil...........did I miss something? What is wrong with you people?If they start doing mean things like this, more Christians will leave republicans party. These people underestimate people's intelligence. I hope it is done to get cheap publicity. The British are good at exploiting human differences.

"Both Mark and I have nothing but respect and love our president, who is a fellow Christian,"  And we only like members of our little cult.

obamas hero , saul alinsky , dedicated his book "rules for radicals" to lucifer. barry soetoro is the anti christ or better yet the chocolate devil.

Republicans are still crying?

Maybe the "Bible" producers should be dismissed. Besides, the bible is pure fiction anyway.

they should of had a bush character

dlwy youre a right-wing sicko filthbag--you're a repukelicrap--GUESS WHAT LOSER????YOU LOST--thx BE TO GOD

I do not for one minute believe these produers. Anyone who can see, will notice the resemblance.   Just another disrespect from the wingnut evalgelical group.

It has nothing to do with Obama and more to do with trying to make a mockery out of a mini series about the BIBLE!!!

The ones that satan person looks the President,  are the evil ones!!!!!   How sick!  Be ashamed!!White Jesus...so, I can't take this seriously.

I declare 'Bible' producers as total ignorant monkies!!!!

Since their whole movie is as phony as a 3 dollar bill anyway, why should there be anything to fuss over?

America hides behind the vale of being a christian nation. When if you look at their history the only thing they worship is themselves.

what people like glenn beck and anyone else that really believe this nonense need to do is look into the mirror and they will see the true deciples of satin. they all live daily with real hate in there hearts.

Wouldn't it be interesting to find out that Obama is a fan of the show and after reading all these bullchit articles about this finally said, "You know, he kinda does look like me! HA!"
