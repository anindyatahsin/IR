Obama names Jill Biden aide to women's envoy post

WASHINGTON (AP) â€” President Barack Obama has nominated Catherine Russell to lead U.S. efforts on global women's issues at the Department of State. Russell is the chief of staff to Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden.
Obama made the announcement during a White House reception in honor of Women's History Month.
Obama praised Russell for her work on behalf of women and for helping Jill Biden and first lady Michelle Obama address the needs of military families. Former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton created the post of ambassador-at-large for women's issues to ensure women and girls are a central part of U.S. foreign policy.
Russell is married to Obama's national security adviser, Tom Donilon.
Obama also saluted women attending the reception for their leadership extending rights and protections for women.
