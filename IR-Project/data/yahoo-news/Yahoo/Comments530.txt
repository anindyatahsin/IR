I really like our local Walmarts as they are clean and have good deals

Wal-Mart has to be the biggest scam that we have today. They sell for less as they have the lesser product in their stores. The stores smell and they are dirty.

Wal-Mart in one of the biggest scam outfits in America and us Americans keep helping them. They work their employees 20 hrs so they do not get any benefits and pay the lowest of any larger retailer in American. Their stores are dirty and so are the people that work there.
