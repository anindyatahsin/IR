Looks more like Robert Plant's (Led Zeppelin) crazy uncle.

So the average person is in parliament representing other average people?  About time!

A "benevolent" dictatorship works best, always has, always will.......................

Introducing Beppe to a bottle of "Selzun Blue" is a top priority!

Looks like a typical leftist POS

it all smells fishy... 1) monti's plan is to squeeze as much money as possible out of the average jack's wallet 2) berlusconi is a mafioso and puttaniere 3) bersani's party fossilized in the early 1990's and no archaeological remain of it has been unearthed so far :) 4) Grillo's party is the scariest thing of all: a chicken with its head chopped off who's still running across the yard... no plan, no aim, any future?

I LIKE this guy....and I LOVE Parma. Let's hope he brings the city back to its former splendor.

Democracy ultimately bankrupts a nation because the people will always vote in the party/politician who promises more spending and "freebies"

Allora, La Superba Genova ritorna!  Hanno formato l'italia ed ora la loro modo risorgia lo spiriro della reppublica. Viva Grillo!

Like almost all protest votes, the 5-Star Movement will implode within a year or 2. The sentiment of the people for change is real but the ''party'' has no coherent policy focus beyond ''throwing out those rascals''. Nor does it have the internal discipline to hold together to make important and potentially unpopular decisions.
