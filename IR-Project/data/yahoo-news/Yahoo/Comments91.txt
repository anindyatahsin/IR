Outright theft that leads to revolution.  Socialism works until you run out of other peoples money...by stealing it.  Banks need to face the people eventually.  Right Bernanke?

Depositors will go to court against the levy and whoever continued their deposits in Cyprus will be repaid in full either with Tax money or in Russian rubles.

Bankers: "Force the people to bail us out, Then we can charge them interest and foreclose on their patrimony."What ever happened to FREE enterprise? If you fail you close the doors...

So it's somehow OK to still have a banking sector that is 3.5 times the size of the entire economy?? Given the foolishness that pervades modern finance, why are we allowing these people this much opportunity to ruin what real people actually work for? Remember, bankers don't produce anything, they just push money around from one place to another.
