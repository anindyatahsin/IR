My con edison bill in new york - the carrying charges to deliver electricity are higher than my electric bill. Once they had shut my electric off and when they restored it sent me a bill with a little bar graff of my gas usage. I dont use gas, never have and yet they created a wonderful bar graf to justify fraudulent charges. They are thieves in my book a monopoly and  no one is in charge of them so thats what happens

If it is not gold or oil leave it alone or you will lose your pants.

DOMINION  is the stock to buy!

Depending upon your investment goals, I'm retired, buy diversified utilities with nice dividends like this one, DUK, SO, AVA, PNY, EXC,  &amp; SCG balanced out with T &amp; VZ all for the income.  Looking for growth, then the Oil and Gas CVX, COP, chemicals DD, flipping stocks, then the money center banks, JPM, BAC, WFC

Utilities are out of favor. Isn't that when you're suppose to buy ? Buy Low sell High. Last year the banks was Dogs now their shining. I'll wait until Excelon recovers, in the meantime i'll collect the 5.4% dividend.....

where is ed going

How about the insurance co NOT paying off for the Crystal River Nuclear Plant due to inept management attempt to repair it and making it worse.  If Duke purchases Progress it takes on that multi-billion responsibility, no?

Duke is a solid company and with it's purchase of Progress it is a great long term investment.I believe approval for the acquisition will take time.As a Canadian,there are some interesting plays in the US market.My next foray,will be in Brazil and a few selected emerging markets.One note of caution,please use due diligence.

What will the value of duke be when  the reverse split takes affect in 2012?  3 for 1

buySo what should I do with this great information?

duk is making me nervous. constantly declining since the merger.

Sell sell.

Why?
