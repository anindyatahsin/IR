A couple of years ago Pelosi started her move to confiscate 401K's. How long do you think a 401K is safe?

A new study from the widely respected National Bureau of Economic Research released this week has confirmed beyond question that the left's race-baiting attacks on the housing market (the Community Reinvestment Act--enacted under Carter, made shockingly more aggressive under Clinton) is directly responsible for imploding the housing market and destroying the economy.The study painstakingly sorted through failed home loans that caused the housing market collapse and identified an overwhelming connection between them and CRA mortgages.

UNIONS SUCK !!!!!!!!!!

With everything that is going on in Cypress today and the liberals trying to confiscate 10% of all savings, why would anyone agree to a 401K. Especially with the direction obama has already indicated he is taking us as far as 401Ks go, he thinks they belong to HIM.

Meanwhile Airbus just signed the biggest airline sale deal in their history!  Organized labor just keeps on flushing us down the toilet.

proof unions and members are moronic id iots ... i hope boeing hires replacements at half the cost ... unions = collective blackmail

Switching from a pension to a 401(k) is not a downgrade.  Boeing's version of a 401(k) is a very good option for employees.

I think the union is going to brake boeing. to many strikes to many gripes. to much money and time spent on contracts that can brake boeing. I am making great money no union and can pay my bills. the trouble is people just are not happy with what they have anymore and just want more more more. screw em boeing ship all production to china pay 2 bucks an hour!!!!

MILLIONS of 401k's were wiped out with the Bush bank crash in 2008 !

STRIKE STRIKE STRIKE!!!!  What???  Boeing is going to close our plant and ship the jobs to Mexico???  I'll be back to work in 15 minutes, let me my grab my lunch.
