James Cramer has also given up on AAPL.

Apple shares were down 13, now only down 8.  I wonder who is buying.

THE INSIDER SELLING/BUYING RATIO HAS BEEN RUNNING CLOSE TO 50 TO 1 FOR THE PAST 6 MONTHS. I TAKE NO COMFORT FROM THIS, REGARDLESS OF WHAT THE TALKING HEADS ON CNBC MIGHT SAY.

APPLE IS THE STOCK TO BUY  . GOING UP, UP, AND AWAY TO $850.00

APPLE IS STILL TOO CHEAP  COMPARED TO THEIR EARNINGS   . BUY THIS STOCK UNDER $650.00

apple is not a computer company

Why not take the market down 25% and get it over with.

Poor Apple.....it never made its run to $500.  BooHoo

Computer Companies? Lexmark is not a computer company. IBM isn't either. Dell - yes. HP and AAPL - party.
