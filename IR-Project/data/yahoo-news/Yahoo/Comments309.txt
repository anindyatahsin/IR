Watch the movie "Food Inc." It will change your way of thinking about what you eat forever!  In our house, we have been trying for years to eat as little meat as possible because of the hormones, antibiotics, disease, pesticides, preservatives and on and on.  There are lots of good alternatives out there!   You only have to look and you will be a lot healthier!

buying organic for guarantee of purity/ integrity ?? only two things guaranteed in life im staying  white and im gonna die.. the rest is gibberish..

a silver lining

Organic horse meat... now that is a great idea... I do not see why people get so warped out of shape about horse meat. In Europe it was a great deal better then some of the beef I was served..

wait till they test for human meat!

What on earth has 'organic' got to do with fraudulent and criminal activity in the meat packing industry?
