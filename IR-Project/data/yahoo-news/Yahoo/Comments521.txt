Short len go look insider selling huge look up teaxs 724 home up for quick sale short this pig now!!!!

A ShockerInventory of new homes is down to 4.5 month.  Lowest in 50yrs!Year over yr sales in units are up +27%Median price is up by +12% and mean price is up by +14%In terms of dollars, homes sold is up +45% year over year.

LEN has started sky rocketing even before the market has recovered. IMO it is over priced. I also think HOV is overpriced.  That leaves KBH or I will wait for weakness in the stocks.  That weakness may come as we approach the financial cliff. The jobless numbers are not stable yet either and may go back up at the next update.

More new jobs and businesses will give jump to home builders andnot only to make profit but to build more and more.Bye

Home builders will suffer more in coming months and years becauseno new job created by our president obama and he failed in all hispromises and one thing he did not promise and he did it that hefollowed the wrong way what george bush started in afghanistan.If he stopped when he became a president our country was in betterthan now in worst.bye
