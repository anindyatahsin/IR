Why are so many young people on the wrong track? They are angry and have no good purpose in life....seeking only to do evil and harm others. Seems too many  with questionable motives hide behind a student persona. Check these people out before allowing into our country! He carried out his own death sentence...

What a blessing! It proves that schools are subjected to radical and deranged individuals to carry out mass murders! Where in the middle east is he from? How wonderful that he blew brains out! It's time to do some serious background checks on the people who enter this country! Of course when our government releases illegal aliens into the public it makes you wonder who the hell is running this country!

WEED did this and no GOD in his life or church in his life either .

Marijuana would not make any person do that. That guy jus had a bad life and wanted to take it out on others
