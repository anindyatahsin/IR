Arias prosecutor attacks witness credibility

PHOENIX (AP) â€” Testimony has concluded for the day in Jodi Arias' murder trial after a prosecutor questioned the objectivity and techniques used by a defense witness to diagnose the defendant with post-traumatic stress disorder.
Arias faces the death penalty if convicted of first-degree murder in the 2008 death of Travis Alexander in his suburban Phoenix home. Authorities say she planned the attack. Arias initially said she had nothing to do with it then blamed it on masked intruders. She eventually said it was self-defense.
Psychologist Richard Samuels concluded his third day of testimony. He is set to return to the witness stand Wednesday.
He says he met with Arias a dozen times for more than 30 hours over three years and stands by his diagnosis, but he acknowledged some errors in the process.
