An article about an iconic photo that changed the world, and the photo does not acompany the article?  Typical Yahoo.  Yet they have no trouble showing us the latest picture of a Kardashian.

Why didn't yahoo furnish the photos?????

Yes,  have seen the photo that Yahoo has not supplied.  Three American soldiers faced down in the surf on Normandy Beach.  Heart wrenching.  They gave their all June 6, 1944.

so where's the famous photo Yahoo??

If you Google "100 Photographs that Changed the World by Life" the photo will come up

I admire this man so much. It's not easy to walk that photojournalism line between gratuitous sensationalism and true news for your readers. There is a way to ensure those at home understand the realities of war while giving the soldiers their due dignity.

If you want to find the photo do an image search for strock war photo.

Where is the photo Bro??

This man "got it" and as usual you had to beat it through their heads (those in power) to get it seen so Americans could truly see war at it's utmost worst.

Didn't he also tell that woman not to squeeze the Charmin?"REALLY"

wheres the picture idiots?
