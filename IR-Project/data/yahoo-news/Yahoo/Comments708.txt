After all this, Greece, Italy, Spain, etc. the Euro is still worth more than the Dollar. What does that say about the value of the Dollar? Meanwhile Obama says there is no debt problem.

The EUROs have come up with NO WAY to solve their debt crisis in 5 years of meetings and negotiations.  Then they decide to provoke a "bank run" in Cyprus to see if it will spread to Italy, Spain, Portgual, et. al.  These people are bankrupt of ideas, not money!

The Euro will become even more worthless when the Italians, Greeks and Spaniards start lining up at their ATM s.

All to feed the market.... socialist market that is.  Stop corporate welfare.

The euro was worth $1.2948 as of Monday afternoon. In 12 months, the euro will not exist.
