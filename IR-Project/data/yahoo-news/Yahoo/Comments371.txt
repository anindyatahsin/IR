The next reporter who entitles anything "LAST GLANCE:" should be hog-tied and dipped upside down in a barrel of ink and left to rot on the last cruise ship headed south.  Scared the bejeebees out 'a me.

MACD crossing on UAL...triple top break out!

Never INVEST in airlines, as they are not an INVESTMENT.  Don't touch them!!!!!

Why is Hawaiian Airlines  never mentioned 2 billion a year revenue, 20 wide bodies. You would be insane to short airlines now, they will make a fortune if oil stays at this price.
