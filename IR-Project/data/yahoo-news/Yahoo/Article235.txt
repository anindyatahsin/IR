Syrian opposition meets to form interim government

ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) â€” Members of Syria's main opposition group are meeting in Turkey to form a rival government to President Bashar Assad's regime.
Twelve candidates are running for the job of an interim prime minister for areas the rebels control. The candidates are mostly exile-based technocrats, although two of the nominees live in the government-controlled areas.
Monday's meeting of the Western-backed Syrian National Coalition is taking place in Istanbul, Turkey. It's the group's most serious effort to form an interim cabinet since the uprising against Assad's rule started two years ago. The conflict has since turned into a civil war in which at least 70,000 have been killed.
A vote is expected by Tuesday.
Two previous attempts to elect a prime minister failed due to divisions.
